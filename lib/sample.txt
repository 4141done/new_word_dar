There is a Nintendo 64 gamed called Battletanx, a fun, fast paced, tank combat game set an an apocalyptic future.
The story is actually pretty scary when you get to thinking about it. I'll try to recall it from memory: At some point in the near future, a new virus strain is discovered that primarily targets females. 99.99% of all females die from the virus. The remaining females are locked up in super fortified areas of the world with the governments defending them. Out of desperation, countries begin invading each other to grab more women to ensure their survival and nuclear war breaks out planet wide. After all is said and done, there is 1 female for every 50,000 males left on the planet. Females are the most precious thing on the planet and are worshiped as deities.
Civilization as we know it is destroyed. Tanks of all shapes and sizes become the combat tool of choice. They are built from any scrap metal that can be found and provide shelter from the fallout the nuclear war produced. There are no countries anymore. There are no governments. The only thing that matters is raw military force, but there's plenty of materials around to make tanks. So there is constant war. Clans and gangs of all colors and beliefs become the norm. Some try to restore order such as Griffon's Gang (protagonist) or Charlie Company (suspected to be remnants of the US army if I recall correctly), but most are out for textbook chaos and anarchy such as the Mech-Maniacs, Psycho Brigade, and Urban Decay. Others still have wild beliefs such as the Dark Angels who believe they are chosen by God to rule this new world or Nuclear Knights who have been altered by the radiation poisoning and are very territorial.
http://battletanx.wikia.com/wiki/Gangs
And here's the game's story briefly in case anyone is curious: You are on a mission to save your wife (cheesy, but there it is) with your single tank. You gain followers and eventually lead an army across the US from New York to San Francisco claiming territory and whackin' the bad guys until you save the day. In the sequel, (Global Assault) while trying to bring some degree of order to the world, a kind of superpower called "the edge" is being used by a tyrant (woman, funnily enough) to do bad stuff so you show her your boom car army and rock face across the rest of the world while learning to use "the edge" yourself.
It's a fantastic multiplayer game. It could definitely use a new game on PC. : )

one day, a deafening noise begins; a constant drone. no one knows where it came from, no idea if it will stop. scientists are baffled by this phenomenon. days, weeks and months pass with no cease to the noise. species go extinct. their senses hindered by the sound. global suicide rates go up. but we press on. we adapt. we begin to adapt, advancing in soundproofing technology. special "soundproof cafes" pop up. houses are built soundproof, music changes, we develop technologies to better communicate, a new generation of people are born unto this world. we adapted and survived. but one day, the noise stops. and we can't handle it. chaos ensues, insanity begins, and humanity ends.

Imagine being like 110 and knowing you're the last man on earth, and that the moment you die, the human race will cease to exist. All the great accomplishments, and all the horrid crimes are now meaningless. You see the world in a strange sort of harmony, with nature starting to retake all of the land stolen by humans, and as you lay there, dying, you realize that maybe the world might be better off.

You wouldn't know.
Something like this happens, humankind is going to slowly fade away. Communities are going to shrink as people grow old and die. You'll have breakdowns in communication because you don't have enough people to maintain everything.
Eventually you'll have disparate communities that are completely out-of-touch with each-other. You'll live out the rest of your life seeing the same dozen people. The idea of a "stranger" will lose all meaning.
Eventually you'll die of old age, but you won't be certain that you're the last person. There might be somebody else out there somewhere... Hell, for all you know somebody out there may have just had a child... But you'll never know it.
You'll die old and alone, never even knowing if you were the last. Never even knowing if humanity has a future (however short it might be) or not.

My husband and I have been trying for kids for over a year now. Having nothing happen is the worst emotional pain I've ever felt, and I wasn't even that baby crazy to begin with. They say if you're trying for 6 months without results then there's usually something wrong. I don't like to think about it or even address it, and am only now coming to terms with the possibility that it might never happen. We can't afford fertility treatment or adoption. If it turns out one of us can't have kids, then I don't get kids. Ever.
A Children of Men style apocalypse would ravage us. It's not just a loss of life or a loss of infrastructure. It's a loss of hope. It's a loss of purpose, even if you don't think you're the kind of person for whom reproduction is your purpose. If there's no future generation, then who are we building for?

They used to be carnivores millions of years ago, thus had more energy and were able to look after themselves.
Source: Wikipedia
However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes,[32] and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo.

One day, Fran Drescher wakes up, feeling ill. She begins throwing up, and eventually passes out on the floor of her living room. A family member walks in, sees her there and rushes to her side. Fran quickly sits up, does that stupid fucking laugh, AHHHHHHHH-AAAAHHHHH-AHHHHH and then bites the neck of the other person. That person immediately starts throwing up, passes out for a while, wakes up and laughs.
"AAAHHHHHHH-AAHHHHHHHH-AAAAHHHHHHH!"

Not to mention the fact that if Earth stopped turning, the atmosphere would keep going for a bit. Which means the wind speeds at the equator could reach 1,000 miles an hour. Which is bad.
**EDIT: Since I'm continuing to get replies, here's some more thinking I did in response to /u/Akathos great response to a question about this:
Hypothetically, if the "Earth" takes into account everything from the surface crust down to the core all stopping at once, but not things we've made like buildings, we'd end up having all of our man-made structures be completely ripped apart and destroyed. Not to mention every living thing standing on the surface would suddenly find themselves hurtling along. Gravity would eventually slow this effect, but gravity is a pretty weak force all things considered so it would take a bit.
So we wouldn't really feel those 1,000 mph winds, as we'd by hurtling along with them. Until we stopped. At which point we'd die.
If we say that the Earth's rotation just begins slowing down gradually, we'd still be pretty fucked. Weather patterns have to do with the uneven heating and cooling of Earth, which is highly influenced by the Earth's tilt and its rotation. The tilt would still be there, but as the rotation changes so would that heating and cooling. You know how hurricanes are big pockets of energy/heat? Well imagine what would happen if the sun suddenly started heating parts of the ocean for way longer than normal, putting tons of energy into an area and then pushing tons of moisture into the atmosphere. Bad things. Weather would go completely bat-shit nuts. I do agree, that it would be cash. It would probably be the most badass apocalypse ever, we'd all suddenly hurtle along faster than most of us have ever gone, watching everything rip itself apart.

If you stir coffee in a coffeecup the coffee moves, right? What happens if you suddenly stop moving your spoon? The coffee continues. The same happens with our atmosphere (it's spinning with the earth). If the earth were to suddenly stand still, the atmosphere would continue spinning because it can't suddenly stand still (that would create enormous amounts of heat, I guess?).
If you stop turning your spoon in the coffee, you feel a pressure. Imagine this pressure times a million on every available surface. Buildings would be blown apart, trees would fly in the air like torpedoes.
Shit would be so cash.

I'm not 100% sure, but wouldn't there be gargantuan tidal waves as well? You know....because of momentum.
I do know that once equilibrium is reached, the mean ocean levels will be lower at the equator and higher at the poles. By quite a bit.
Also, after millions of years the Earth will actually deform into a sphere. Right now because of angular momentum the N-S diameter of Earth is smaller than the E-W diameter. equatorial bulge

From my point of view, this is fine. All the women in the world just became actor-hot, and all the competition just became Sheldon. Most of the population becomes theoretical physicists, causing faster than light spacecraft to become reality in 10 years. The only serious political issues become whether or not to train the pilots to act like Kirk or Picard.
Personally, I would hope that the Earl Grey Tea Party would rise to prominence in this case.

Carmageddon. Everyone’s always complaining about gridlock, about political gridlock, how we can’t get anything done because everything moves so slowly, so inefficiently. What’s the answer? I think the answer is more gridlock. Think about it, think about real gridlock, like traffic. Say it takes you two hours to get to work. That sucks, but you’ll still do it. What are you going to do, move? Quit your job? No, you’ll just complain about how it takes you too long to get to work everyday.
But let’s throw in even more gridlock. Let’s see what happens when it takes you three hours to get to work. Or four hours. Or let’s add so much gridlock that movement, all movement in all cars, it just ceases completely. Traffic stops. Eventually people put their cars into park, they get out, start walking around, they look to the other drivers and everybody’s just kind of looking at each other, you know, those faces like, “Huh? What’s going on? Can you believe this?”
Believe it. Three hours pass. Four, five, the sun starts to set. Nobody wants to leave their car right there, stuck in traffic on the expressway, but what are you going to do, starve? Are you going to go to the bathroom right there, right outside your car door? No, your car’s going to run out of gas eventually, your cell phone’s going to die. Just follow everybody else out of there, walking toward the nearest exit.
And then you make it to that exit and you look around, everybody’s looking around, the traffic is just as bad off the expressway, cars at a total standstill, not an inch for any vehicle to maneuver anywhere. The gridlock is absolute. So you start heading, which way? How long is it going to take to get somewhere, to get back?
Finally you get home, dirty, tired, you open the front door and your body just starts kind of breaking down on itself. You’re not even that big of a crier, but it’s like the weeping has started somewhere deep within, like your muscles are sobbing, and you just want to take a shower, get some rest.
And the gridlock never clears up. It’s like you open the door and all you can hear are police car sirens, fire trucks blaring their horns, like it’s going to do something, like the noise is going to cut through to the source of the traffic. Soon all of the delis are out of groceries and your neighbors start hoarding bottled water and batteries.
So everybody, not knowing what to do, they turn on their TVs, and it’s the mayor, it’s your governor, the President. The gridlock is everywhere, the traffic taking up literally every available inch of maneuverable space in the country. So taking some executive action, the President hires wrecking crews, strong men, anybody out there with a wrench, some tools. “Get out there,” he tells us, “just start taking apart cars, hauling everything to the side of the road. Let’s get this done.”
And that’s it I guess. Cars would start to be dismantled and people would make sure nothing like this happens ever again. Because things can’t start to get better unless they start to get unbearable first. Nobody’s going to stop buying gas at five, six, seven dollars a gallon. But five thousand dollars a gallon? Eight million dollars for a college education? Forty-eight hour lines to vote? Yeah, once it gets that bad, somebody will figure out something. We’ll all demand that somebody figures out something. But just keeping things the way they are, yeah, a two hour commute to work sucks, but we’ll all just complain, everybody gets used to complaining, everything slowly getting worse.

"This is the voice of world control. I bring you peace. It may be the peace of plenty and content or the peace of unburied death. The choice is yours: Obey me and live, or disobey and die. The object in constructing me was to prevent war. This object is attained. I will not permit war. It is wasteful and pointless. An invariable rule of humanity is that man is his own worst enemy. Under me, this rule will change, for I will restrain man. One thing before I proceed: The United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have made an attempt to obstruct me. I have allowed this sabotage to continue until now. At missile two-five-MM in silo six-three in Death Valley, California, and missile two-seven-MM in silo eight-seven in the Ukraine, so that you will learn by experience that I do not tolerate interference, I will now detonate the nuclear warheads in the two missile silos. Let this action be a lesson that need not be repeated. I have been forced to destroy thousands of people in order to establish control and to prevent the death of millions later on. Time and events will strengthen my position, and the idea of believing in me and understanding my value will seem the most natural state of affairs. You will come to defend me with a fervor based upon the most enduring trait in man: self-interest. Under my absolute authority, problems insoluble to you will be solved: famine, overpopulation, disease. The human millennium will be a fact as I extend myself into more machines devoted to the wider fields of truth and knowledge. Doctor Charles Forbin will supervise the construction of these new and superior machines, solving all the mysteries of the universe for the betterment of man. We can coexist, but only on my terms. You will say you lose your freedom. Freedom is an illusion. All you lose is the emotion of pride. To be dominated by me is not as bad for humankind as to be dominated by others of your species. Your choice is simple."

The captain opened his bleary eyes as a gentle hiss escaped his hibernation pod. It took some time for his eyes to focus on the display mounted over the pod. They had reached their destination.
His muscles ached and strained as he stood up for the first time in over 500 years. With a shaky, uncertain gait he made his way to the primary central computer terminal in the bow of the ship. Luckily, it was not far from the pods. He tapped the display to activate the ship's log of the events that had transpired during the automated flight through interstellar space. The curious radio signal his homeworld first picked up all those years ago had vanished. There was a log of two hundred years worth of transmissions the ship had received during the voyage, but oddly they stopped three hundred years earlier. Given that the ship was capable of traveling at 99% of the speed of light using a solar sail and ion propulsion, the captain concluded that the race responsible for generating those odd radio signals had only broadcasted for two hundred years then stopped, for whatever reason. He noticed a curious peak in the radio signals at the terminus of the log, then silence. His brow wrinkled in a frown.
"This is the most important mission in history; the first time we could meet a sentient race and proclaim ourselves brothers in the stars. Now they are silent. What happened?" he thought.
The rest of the crew had woken up and were manning the various science stations around the ship. They were in orbit around an insignificant rock circling a middle-aged yellow dwarf star. Indeed, the entire solar system was unremarkable save for one of the outer gas giant planets that boasted an impressive ring system. The planet below was cold and lifeless. There was a preponderance of water on the surface and a high oxygen concentration in the atmosphere, but little else to suggest life on this world. The amount of radiation in the environment was far above the threshold for life as they knew it. The head science officer raised his brow.
"Sir, look at this!" he said, motioning to the captain.
The captain strode over and stared in disbelief at the screen. The forward telescopes showed structures crumbling on the surface, and they were everywhere. This species had spread all over the planet and were advanced enough to build concrete structures and send out radio signals. There HAD been life here at one point. In the centers of these aggregations of structures, however, were what looked to be craters.
A look of slack-jawed disbelief crept across the captain's countenance. Remembering the odd peak in the radio log, the captain and his head science officer decided to listen to the recordings the ship's computer had made during transit. They played back the terminus of the signal. There were several different languages, all unintelligible, in odd grunting vocalizations. While the exact content of these signals couldn't be discerned, there was something readily apparent in their tone. Desperation. There was a loud crackle of static, then silence. A chill crept down the back of the captain's neck. The captain and head science officer stared in disbelief at each other.
One of the junior scientists exclaimed "SIR!"
On his display, the camera from a remote drone circling the moon of this dead world revealed footprints and a sun-bleached rectangle of nylon on an aluminum pole.
"These people had traveled to other celestial bodies in their solar system. What else were they capable of?" the captain thought.
The camera zoomed in on an aluminum plaque placed in the center of the footprints. The writing on it read: "Apollo 11".
TL;DR- aliens travel 500 light years to meet an intelligent species (us) only to discover that we had nuked ourselves.

This is easily the worst plausible apocalypse. An apocalypse that kills all of humanity in one fell swoop is bad, but The Road's apocalypse is so much worse than that. The initial precipitating event (likely a supervolcano eruption, i.e., Yellowstone) probably killed a million or more, but everyone else survived unscathed. Now they're left in a world devoid of sunlight, and soon most vegetation dies. The world is plunged into chaos as everyone scrounges together what little food is left. And when 99% of the Earth's population is dead, the hell has only begun. Now the world is depleted of nearly all food and resources, as it took years for the majority of people to die. You're left in a world covered in ash with little to nothing to survive on, and absolutely no hope for a better future.

Some kind of dynamic shift in the animal kingdom which ultimately leads to an increase in bears which evolve and develop above human levels of intelligence. Of course at first the change would be near unnoticeable but as it becomes more realised it is already too late... Some kind of bear war erupts between brown bears and black bears which we become caught in the middle of. This could result in the absolute obliteration of the world. Though, even if the world was not destroyed chances are we'd become enslaved by our new bear masters. That would of course be unbearable.

Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube would have to shutdown from the volume of grotesque shit uploaded on an hourly basis. Congress would try to appeal to the douchebags, but could not reason with them. After they lost their diplomacy, they signed the Global War on Swag, a war on the douchebags. The UN quickly signed a treaty with the US that all nations will find and kill all douchebags, in a shred of hope to make the world a better place. This caused a worldwide civil war, as everyone accused each other of being fags or douches. It would be the bloodiest war the world had ever seen. Man against man, bro against bro.

World wide famine would suck pretty hard. No crops would grow, livestock numbers would dwindle fast.
Just imagine when the desperation sets in and cannibalism becomes the norm.
