After the Dark age there was an increase in population and settlement numbers in Greece, and therefore an increase of chattel slavery. Also Hectemoroi and debt-bondsmen were a thing. BUT its also important to note that with chattle slavery (The owning of a person like...a movable possession), even though the people were technically slaves they did have rights and could be higher than other slaves, own other slaves, run their owners business, and they were allowed to participate politically (Which was pretty significant). They could be clerks, domestics, workers, ect and be virtually independent of their owners. They were allowed a wage, and could pay for their stay or for their independence eventually which would make them Metics (Foreigners in the land, not able to be a full citizen or own land) . Slavery happened by self sale, kidnapping, parents giving away their children, ect. It was a normal thing. It wasn't a \"Racist\" thing per-say, but Greece at least was very specific about who was a citizen and who was not, especially after the citizenship law of Pericles in 451-450 BC. Outsiders were very clearly outsiders, allowed to participate in society and the economy but they had their restrictions.

American slaves held two jobs for the main part, working the plantation, or watching the master's children. Also most American slaves worked for large farmers, as income disparities in the South were to great for middle or lower classes to buy even a single slave.  \nUnder Roman rule, slaves served a variety of roles, serving as a companion to their master, teaching the children Greek or mathematics, working on the farm, shopping, etc. Also Roman slaves were generally held by people of all social classes. A poor man might have purchased a single slave to simply help around the house, whereas a wealthy senator may have thousands of slaves tending to various farms, homes, and estates.

I didn't know about that practice, and will definitely be reading that book.\n\nBut I think the bigger issue is that that practice of interbreeding was, according to the book, abolished within a few decades.  But the progeny of that interbreeding were and are still considered \"black\" and them and their descendants likely continued to be slaves until the practice was abolished in their respective countries.\n\nMoreover, I think the reason African-Americans play the slave card (and have the right to do so) is because unlike their Irish counterparts, they can't hide their heritage.  African Americans, and many of African decent in the West Indies, look different from their African counterparts (likely in part due to the aforementioned interbreeding).  \n\nAs a result, while most descendants of Irish slaves (at least those who were not forced to interbreed) would need to do an extensive ancestry search to determine they were slaves in the past, all African Americans need do is look in a mirror.  Indeed, even the ones of Irish descent would not be openly welcomed into an Irish community today.  They would simply be considered black.  All society needs to do is look at the color of their skin, and know that they are the descendants of slaves.   \n\nI'm sure you can understand how psychologically damaging that could be, and why you would have a chip on your shoulder and play the slavery card.

The simple matter of fact is that there are millions of americans who ignore all of these opportunities and then want to blame it on something else.", "I'm sure that happens. I just think creating a more complicated system where you try to not only hand out assistance, but make sure it only gets spent the way you want it will only make the problem worse. \n\nCertainly there is a balancing act necessary to prevent fraud.

Taxpayer has provided you with what you needed to live for the month and left it up to you to fend for yourself.  No need to worry about fraud beyond checking to make sure the person is alive and that they are the ones receiving the checks.  \n\nBut if you do this, then you'd have to be ok with literally every other manner of welfare support being removed and their funding rolled into this.  And there would be no other safety net beyond the monthly check.  So if people are stupid about how they spend it, they suffer for it.  And everybody would have to be ok with this, allowing the suffering to occur, at least at a governmental level (private charities could, of course, do whatever they wanted).\n\nIf you think that the government should help these people (the ones who have burned through the safety net and have nothing left to help them) then there is no punishment for essentially defrauding the government/taxpayers by not using what was given as means for sustenance and survival in appropriate fashion.\n\nBut as it stands, not everyone is being given this sum of cash every month or year, and because of that, the government should have the authority to ensure that those who are directly benefiting from its support follow the laws that are a part of the social contract that we, apparently, live under consensually.  To demand that the government fulfill its obligation to the citizenry while pardoning those who benefit from their obligations serves to void, in a sense, the contract.", "I don't that's necessary at all. That implies there is some level of total equality required. As if just because a person is starving in the street is provided help, I should *also* be entitled to receive help. That just doesn't make any sense, and it's also not in line with the rest of the redistribution model. \n\nJust like progressive tax systems, people with more money pay more taxes, if you make less than the poverty line, you pay no taxes (in reality the cut off is much lower than the poverty line). Following the logic of the tax model there is no reason that the government needs to provide welfare to all citizens just because it provides it to people in poverty. \n\n&gt;But as it stands, not everyone is being given this sum of cash every month or year, and because of that, the government should have the authority to ensure that those who are directly benefiting from its support follow the laws that are a part of the social contract\n\nI'm just saying that I think it's less effective system. As I mentioned in another part of this thread, you have to question what you want out of the system. Do you want to create an effective method of reducing the harm caused by poverty (higher crime, lower education levels, etc..) or do you want a system that maximizes your personal sense of justice. \n\nYou might feel that it's unfair that one person gets welfare and spends tax money on drugs, but if in aggregate measurements of the system, it works better to allow those *abuses* and generally improve society, wouldn't that be worth it? \n\nIf you look to the way welfare is handled in Canada, it's just a cheque. No food stamps, no drug testing, no mandatory labour (work for welfare program etc..), just money in the bank. There's nothing stopping someone from still receiving charity in other means, or going to the foodbank. Overall the Canadian system is more effective even though there are less controls in place to prevent abuses (although you do need to investigate fraud). I can't say for sure it's more effective *because* there are less controls, but I'm inclined to believe it.

This all costs money, right? Yes, but a lot of money is saved by not overburdening the courts with bullshit weed busts, people carrying small amounts of drugs are fined and not arrested and many times they're forced to do community service on top of that. Also, treating people and turning them into functioning members of society costs less than having them committing crimes and makes them much less probably to even need welfare.  \n\nForcing welfare recipients for drug tests would be a national outrage  around here, because weed is seen not as harmless, but as much less harmful than alcohol and not that much frowned upon among responsible adults.

This was about four years ago, around the time I first moved out of my parent's house and into my first apartment.\n\nThe first thing I resolved to do was to get a gym membership and start losing weight.  I was nervous, unsure of what to do.  I read the literature, watched the guides, looked at every single weight loss option I could absorb information from.  I stepped into the gym and saw nothing but perfectly sculpted, perfectly built people just maintaining that perfection while I, like a Pizzabeast of yore, stumbled into the gym wearing my parachute of a shirt and gym shorts that had no chance of ever hiding all of my ass crack. \n\nI was already sweating, this wasn't the place for me.  These people were gorgeous and I was a mountain of lard and failure.  I left without ever stepping on anything.\n\nMy gym card sat on my desk for weeks, possibly even a month, before I decided to try again.  I had still kept up with my diet, which I cheated on a lot so it was pretty ineffective at doing anything beyond slowing the rapid expansion of my ass.  I have a weekend alone so I decide to go back and try again.  I don my parachute and low riders and walk through the door, damnit I'm gonna get on a treadmill.  I get on the only free treadmill in the gym, it's packed.  The thing groans under me, and I familiarize myself with the controls.  To my left is a thin, attractive girl who looks to be about half the size of my thigh.  To my right is a beast of a man, muscle head to toe in what I could only imagine was a homage to Arnold Schwarzenegger's body building days.  They're both jogging at what was an insane pace for me to even consider, and the timers on their treadmills were ludicrous.  How the fuck were they doing THAT for THAT long?!\n\nAlready discouraged, I start off at a brisk walk that DESTROYS ME after 15 minutes.  My water bottle is already empty and I'm sweating like a broken fire hydrant, I just know I smell like curdled milk and look like the most disgusting thing to ever congeal out of semen.  I take another step and slip, just as some people are passing behind me.  I fumble and land on my ass, the treadmill stops from what I assumed at the time was my titanic ass destroying its will to live any longer, though there was a safety.  The people on all sides give out a variety of snickers, some stifled, and some just making snide comments between each other that I hear as I waddle my way out of the gym in immense shame.  I was never coming back.\n\nMy depression grew, my diet broke, I succumbed to my own self-pity.  One day I was sitting on the toilet, looking at the mirror across from me at the gigantic marshmallow of sweat and grease that I was and I could see what they were laughing at.  It made me mad.  It made me mad not at them, but at myself.  I was mad that this is what I was, I was so mad sitting there on the toilet that I would never be one of those people who laughed at me for being so pathetic.  I was mad at everything.  I was so mad, so mad that I couldn't care.  This anger grew quickly, it wasn't just a bathroom event but something that carried out with me afterwards throughout the days that followed.  Finally I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nI didn't care if they laughed, I didn't care if I fucked up again.  I looked at all my resources and refreshed my morale, though it was still pretty low.  I threw away all my junk food, got rid of sodas for good.  I developed an intense diet of plain chicken breast, rice, and water.  I tortured myself with it, I tortured myself with it because I hated myself and this was me taking it out on me while also trying to fix it.  I accepted my self-induced punishment, even when I would wake up craving something bad so intensely that I thought I'd go insane.\n\nI also returned to the gym, and for weeks into months I stomped my way up that treadmill.  The mirror became my inspiration.  I hated it, I hated looking at it, I hated pictures of me, I hated anything that reminded me of this huge cage of fat I was wrapped in.  Slowly and slowly I started to shed it, the scale started reading lower and lower numbers, eventually once the water weight fell off progress slowed, but that just made me angrier and increased my devotion to the plan.\n\nYeah, I fell some more, I stumbled, I tripped, and more people laughed.  God I didn't like that, but I hated myself even more, and those laughs only brought me back the next day with twice the conviction.\n\nI didn't keep a log, or keep track of my diet beyond that all I ate was plain white meat, rice, and water in moderate quantity.  I just kept going back to the gym whenever I got the chance.  I didn't keep track of time either.  Just every day I could, it felt like I could sweat more and more of that self-loathing out.  All I did was get on that treadmill that people had laughed at me for falling off of.  Eventually I stopped falling.  I stopped falling and I started running.  I hadn't even noticed the change, I just knew that every day I had to come back.  My anger at myself never subsided, it was what drove me through the gym, and it was what turned a waddle into a sprint when before I knew it two years later I had was running through the park in a sprint, 185lbs, and no one was laughing.\n\nI still go to the gym every day, and I've started picking up the weights now and developed a huge love for them.

I felt good working out and losing weight but felt so damn awkward while doing it.  I hated going to the gym because I was ashamed of my body (while at the gym).  So hearing people make fun of me or make comments about my weight was just demolishing my motivation to go back each day and work out.

And here I was working out, with my completely drenched shirt, struggling with the weight I was doing, out of breath, shaking from the work, and I see/hear these people make fun of me.\n\nThere was nothing worse than hearing that.  But at one point some guy that worked out at the same time started talking to me.  We kinda became workout buddies without ever working out together.  We'd nod at each other, spot each other at times, offer some encouragement, and every time he'd say \"see you tomorrow!\"  I felt obligated to go back because it seemed like somebody was counting on me, like me being there helped him.  There was one day we were walking out of the gym together and going down the steps my legs were shaking, I felt like I was walking on jelly.  I tried to open the door but my arms were just so exhausted that it was awkward as hell.  Some guys see that and laugh a little as they walk out without a drop of sweat.  My friend looks at me and says something like \"man nothing beats that feeling of working out so hard you can barely function.  I fucking love it!  It tells me that I worked my ass off.  It tells me that I didn't quit, that I didn't stop when I felt comfortable.  I stopped when I couldn't do any more, and as long as I have that feeling when I leave I know I worked as hard as I could and it will pay off.\"\n\nI realized that those assholes can make fun of me because I was obese and I was working out and looked awkward as hell.  I can feel bad because other people in the gym are fit, maybe healthy, strong, etc  but that's not what matters.  What mattered was that every time I went to the gym I left there having worked my ass off, drenching my shirt in sweat was not something to be ashamed off, it was something to be proud of.  Walking down the stairs and shaking with every step after working out my legs was a good thing, it means I pushed myself beyond what I'd be comfortable with.  I eventually started feeling bad for those people that made fun of me.  They went to the gym to hang out.  They rarely worked out, instead they sat around making fun of people working harder than them.  They were making fun of me because I busted my ass off to better my life while they sat there laughing and talking with their friends not accomplishing shit.  \n\nI am only talking about the few people that made fun of me, not everyone at the gym is like this and not every gym has asshats like these guys.

But certainly there were NO autistic kids a few generations ago. And there was no such thing as ADD and ADHD, right?\n\nNo, we just didn't know about them. Knowledge and awareness weren't there even though they ARE very real disorders. But like you said, they aren't the norm, though they can certainly affect significant portions of the population and never get discussed (like stereoblindness). To the other side of things, you can have cultural fads make everyone think they've got this or that thing (gluten allergies) when it really isn't the case.\n\nThat's why I recommend talk to a doctor. Lots of doctors aren't aware of the disorder, just as lots of people aren't. And honestly, yours is the attitude most people take towards it. Skepticism that anyone has it and a suggestion that those people are just lazy or hedonistic or whatever.

When I was unemployed for a while I did fall into the typical DSPD sleeping period of ~4am-noon, maybe  closer to 6am-2.

I'm self employed now, but in order to keep my customers I have to be here answering the phone when they call first thing in their government job morning. I'm not strict enough with myself to keep a strict schedule and stay in darkness before bed, and I don't like taking prescription drugs for anything non-recreational (don't like the idea of being dependent on a pill for anything). I may try melatonin, but don't want to end up using it every day.

I held down a normal job for a large chunk of my life, but it was always insanely hard to keep the schedule. Lots of people just chalk it up to a lack of enthusiasm, but any time I was on Flex Time or could make my own hours, I excelled. And that was WAY before I found out this was a disorder people have. I could do a few weeks of forcing myself onto the schedule before I'd become depressed and stressed and all sorts of bullshit. Like I said, genetic jackpot.\n\nHell, even when I do force myself onto a different sleep schedule, I feel mentally useless until 11am at the earliest.\n\nAnyway, rather than work-related stuff, I just think it's important for people to know their bodies and what's natural for them so if someone comes at them calling them lazy or flippant about the \"real world\" they at least know it's not necessarily their fault.
