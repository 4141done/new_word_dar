Its not what I want [to have extra partners] but I dont mind you doing it\". We discussed it for several months before I actually started dating someone, and the one time he felt he wasn't getting enough me time, he let me know so I could redirect my focus on him.

Lets say I wake up tomorrow and I'm pissed at him and realize that I just don't feel like dealing with him anymore. I could walk out right then and there and not look back if I wasn't married. Marriage makes you pause and consider your actions (btw, that isn't a realistic scenario in anyway, just painting a picture here). Plus, health insurance is a nice thing to have. Plus, we love each other, why WOULDN'T we marry? We've put a lot of time and energy into our lives together. If I was to end up with another partner, nothing says I wouldn't marry them too!

We lived in a rural suburb of Saint Paul and since we never ever saw the people who lived in this place (which was pretty normal for our neighborhood, not like they were hibernating murders or anything), we started walking our dog to âyour houseâ almost every day and it just became part of our story. âWalking the dog to Neilâs?â âAlright, get your coat.â We later got to see the real you at âWitsâ and you were wonderful (along with the extremely cool Josh Ritter) and I guess the rest is history/we are huge fans for life. I guess I just wanted to tell you that you have been, in metaphorical-fantasy-living-next-to-me and literal terms, a huge positive influence on my life, my art and my relationship with my brother. And so I thank you. Creativity and Story is all we have as a human race (Make good art?) and I am so thankful that they have a champion like you. I donât know what else to say, good luck with your future projects and come back to Minnesota once and a while! (Weâve both moved on to college at this point but we look back at your house with the fondest of memories).\n \n\n\n\n\nAmanda â I use your music and blog as a sort of cultural barometer. This is the highest honor I can give you, Iâm sorry it doesnât have a more interesting title! If I meet someone new and have them listen to you or read something you wrote or watch your TED talk, I can really tell so much about the person as to what they think. You are a manifestation of so many of my ideals and thoughts about the world and beliefs in things (not to mention artistic taste) that if a new person in my life doesnât understand you or thinks youâre too weird, I know them and I are not going to last. I donât mean this to sound like Iâm looking down from a high horse saying that âI understand these weird thingsâ but rather that you have to let yourself not understand and I know that if someone I meet cannot wrap their head around the wonderfully bright chaotic and âgoodâ aura that you emulate, itâs not that they arenât a good person, but that they donât share the same view of the world as me. I am such a huge supporter of your work and your general thoughts about the world that I canât even explain it. You are smart, talented, hilarious, kind, and intellectual and let me tell you that is hard to find (even in the wide world of the âinternetâ or âfamous peopleâ). You stand up for the weak and the people that donât always have champions and I want to tell you that that is the noblest work there is. I am humbled to be your fan. GAH youâre so cool! I hope Iâm expressing my thoughts on why I love you properly, but if Iâm not just pretend that you understand because this is deep shittt! Keep on fighting and Iâm excited to see everything coming down the proverbial pipeline.\n \n\n\n\n\nTHANKS COOL GUYS. Iâm coming to NYC this Saturday to see âAn Evening With Youâ so Iâm extremely excited. The related theme between my two long paragraphs (forgive me people of reddit!) is that you two are champions for what I believe to be the good in the world and I am really thankful there are people like you out there. There are a lot of champions for evil out there, and itâs nice to remember that while there is less on the other side, they are still a force to be reckoned with.", "That's wonderful. (See you on Saturday.)", "I just wanted to stop in and say that both of you are my heroes. \n\nI got to meet you, Neil, at a signing in New York City back in 2010. I was an intern in the city sleeping on couches, far away from my home in Texas. You gave me a big hug and signed my copy of American Gods. That was both 1) the nicest anyone was to me in the entire four months I spent unsuccessfully living my dream and 2) a surprisingly fantastic hug. I expected one of those shoulder-pat thank-you-for-being-here-today kinda things but you really brought your hug A-game. \n\n(to put this in context, when I was in high school and had just read Sandman, I BEGGED my mom to buy me a leather jacket so that I could be cool like you. I wore that thing to school every day, from December through June. In TEXAS. It was nuts and I think it weirded all of the people around me out but at the time I thought it was the coolest thing in the world). \n\nI met you, Amanda, at a show you did last year. You took a picture with me even though you were tired and you signed the fancy Kickstarter book that came with the CD - (I'm sorry about that but also very grateful!) I first discovered your music, weirdly enough, around the same time I read Sandman. I was 16 years old and bought the first Dresden Dolls CD for a friend but ended up keeping it and getting him an extra copy. I didn't realize that as a girl, you could just choose not to shave - and even more, that you could just do whatever weird thing made you feel powerful and unique. Listening to your music made me feel both vulnerable and strong at the same time.\n\nBoth of you made me feel comfortable in my skin during the most uncomfortable years of my life. My family situation during my adolescence was tumultuous and you both offered me very precious escapes from all the stuff that was going on. Neil's books and comics taught me to dream bigger. Sandman made me fall in love with space and time in comics. Amanda, the Dresden Dolls (and later, your solo stuff) made me feel tough and strong at a time when I really didn't. \n\nI'm sorry to send you a crazy long essay, I just want to let you know that I really love you guys and I will pretty much buy, read, consume, and memorize everything that you make forever. &lt;3 Thank you again for guiding me and inspiring me from the time I was an awkward little weirdo onward.

I'm trying to convince friends to read her books.  Which one do you think it would be best to have them start with?", "It depends on the person. Her books are so different, figure out what the person you are talking to likes, then suggest a book based on that. I love Archer's Good best of all, but that's just me.", "Thanks!  I usually end up giving them Charmed Life or Deep Secret, but I'll try out Archer's Goon next :-)", "Hi Neil, I saw you at a booking signing in Ely, I was with the lass who is the current poet Laurent of the Fens.

Some of them. Not all.â \n\nâI liked myths. They weren't adult stories and they weren't children stories. They were better than than that. They just were. Adult stories never made sense, and they were slow to start. They made me feel like there were secrets, Masonic, mythic secrets, to adulthood. Why didn't adults want to read about Narnia, about secret islands and smugglers and dangerous fairies?â \n\nMy question is:\n**How do supernatural qualities change an 'adult story' into a myth and why is it that myths let you, personally, better create 'true art'?**\n\nPS did you ever read the issue of Preacher where Garth Ennis casts you as a vapid, romantic self-obsessive beholden to a poser-goth vampire leader? Did you think that was hilarious or did it cut a little close to the bone? Any enacted vengeance we should know about?\n\nPPS Thanks for giving me some of my favorite-ever stories. Holy crap; 'Ramadan' alone. You are amazing. Thanks.\n\nPPPS Hi Amanda! 'Good Day' was one of my favorite songs in high school.

Itâs been a dream come true to see you return to comics this year and I was curious if there were any other stories you were interested in telling outside of your work for Marvel and DC/Vertigo.    \n   \nIs there any chance you will make it back to the American Southeast anytime soon?  You came through my home town of Columbia, SC and I somehow missed tickets.  My wife called the art museum to ask about standing room or extra tickets to no avail and  I even showed up at an after party listed in our local paper to try and catch you but it turned out it was a misprint.  I would love to have a chance to shake your hand and say thank you.  It would be beyond amazing to see you at [HeroesCon]( http://www.heroesonline.com/heroescon/) this year, itâs one of the last true comic book conventions left and people would go nuts to see you there.    \nAlso, Overture is off to a great start and Iâm excited to see where to it goes.

I think the last time that I really enjoyed a read like that was when I first discovered Vonnegut.

I know that you have both embraced Twitter and other social media to better connect with your fans (I was excited as all hell when I got a response from you, Neil) and, in some cases, drive your career forward - but as a fan who follows you both, how much has Twitter and other sites like it helped you both in maintaining your relationship when you are both traveling and touring so much - often not together?  Obviously phone calls, texts, and things like Skype are more important, but seeing little messages back and forth between you has been rather inspiring - how much of that helps cement your marriage, and how much of it is just to be cute?", "Hello, Neil!\n\nLike countless others I adore Sandman, but I'd like to know your thoughts on other critically-acclaimed works, such as Y The Last Man? Also what is your favorite pizza topping? \n\nThanks!", "To Amanda:\nI think the Ukulele anthem may possibly be my favorite of your songs, and I was wondering:  What is the angriest song you can think of that would transpose or adapt really well to ukulele to challenge the theory that you can't possibly stay mad at anything or anyone if you have a ukulele?", "Hi, Neil and Amanda :D\n\nI think I don't have any questions, just a thank you note to make to Neil.\n\nI own many of your books (including 3 different versions of American Gods and 2 different versions of Preludes and Nocturnes), and I would like to thank you for giving me hope and happiness in each of them. I consider American Gods one of the best books I've ever read, changing the wai I experience life. Neverwhere was also a game-changing for me, helping me get through one of the worst time of my life. It showed me life is made of choices, and you can always find the best one for you. And a special thank you for Ocean at the End of the Lane: It taught me not to take life too serious, and to embrace our inner child.\n\nI cried a lot in these 3 books, and also in Graveyard Book. You give me reasons to keep writing even when I feel I can't everytime I listen to the Make Good Art speech, or read the written speach on the book on my shelf.  And I think that, when something or someone makes you feel like I felt reading those books, that is something or someone special. It's weird to feel that, even when you don't know a person in life, that person tells you more about yourself than yourself.\n\nThank you, once again.\n\nNo, wait, I have a question! When are you comming to Brazil? Bet you have lots and lots of fans here :)", "Halloo! Love you both! Question: what advice would you give people not accustomed (or yet comfortable with) media attention to help remain sane and centered? Are there any things you wished you'd known ahead of time?", "Hey Neil,\n\nWhat would you say is the most difficult part of writing and story telling? Is there a particular aspect of the craft that tends to give you a hard time?", "Welcome Neil and Amanda! Iâm going to start by asking the obvious: whatâs the likelihood of a future collaboration? Also has your marriage had an impact on your creative processes? What are dynamics at your place of residence like? I have to imagine that things can get a bit strange or chaotic sometimes with two talented, successful, and terrifically odd people living in such close and constant proximity.\n\nAmanda- Like many other denizens of the internet, I thoroughly enjoyed the TED talk you recently gave. Do you have any advice for musicians who would be interested in fostering a similar environment amongst bands and other artistic entities? In my experience as a musician, unnecessary tension often arises between bands, especially local ones. Iâd love to have a more supportive and overall communal local music scene.\n\nThank you both for taking the time to do this AMA!\n", "You two are the cutest.

How did your feel evolve while touring? For me it was art, very special being part of.", "Neil,\nYou are by far my favorite writer and have really inspired me to pursue creative writing. American Gods and Ocean at the End of the Lane really made me want to sit down and just write.\n\nMy question is, what inspired you to start writing and what keeps you writing?", "I don't have a question but I just wanted to say I love you both.\n\nNeil your books are great, I loved American Gods, and Amanda, your music is so personal, I'm sure that everyone who listens feels the same way but it's like you wrote it just for me. You guys are my absolute favorite couple and I love using your open-relationship as an example when arguing the pros of polyamory/non-monogamy. \n\nThanks for existing and for doing this AMA. It means a lot. &lt;3", "Neil, what book have you written do you think that child Neil would like the best?", "Dear Neil and Amanda,\n\nI want to ask for some advice with a problem I'm sure you two have dealt with. What do I do now that Art and Theatre feel like work? It's silly, but I believe the therapeutic feeling I got once has dissipated and I'm sort of running on fumes. I realize that it might be my environment and it might be my temperament, but I wanted to ask you guys what keeps your artistic drive in gear? What makes you wake up and want to create something?\n\nI'm hoping to glean something from your collective wisdoms.\n\nP.S. It was awesome getting to hang out with you two over the summer. Thanks for coming to the show and the subsequent party. I never got quite tipsy enough to express to Neil the extent of my gratitude for all of Sandman, so thanks for Sandman, Neil. It meant a lot for me.", "I bumped into both of ya'll during this past SXSW at the Austin Convention Center. I asked for a picture with Amanda but felt bad about keeping you from whatever duties so I then asked for a hug. That is the best hug I have ever had and it made my year. \nSorry Neil if I just ignored you. I knew of you and had read some of your novels but I had never seen what you looked like. I promise a giant three way hug if we ever bump into each other again.", "Hi Neil and Amanda!\n\nMy girlfriend just loves both of you! She read all Neil's books she could fin in Portuguese (we're Brazilians), and she loves Amanda music also. Using her words, \"you are perfect being imperfect\". She is introducing me to all of your works.\n\nAnd she made me promise I would come here to ask Amanda where she can find this dress! https://twitter.com/amandapalmer/status/402515291738894336/photo/1 \n\nI'm pretty sure that, I she found it, she would use it in her wedding.

What book did you read that made you realize that you wanted to be a writer ", "Hey, Neil, I'm a big fan, and, coincidentally, a friend of Ananda Walker's. I help moderate a small creative writing subreddit, IAmAFiction, and I was wondering if you'd like to do a post there. The format is the same as this subreddit, except you present it as an interview witb one of your fictional characters, and answer questions in character.

You both signed my copy of Fragile Things (my ultimate favourite Gaiman book ever; sorry I didn't have anything of yours to sign, Amanda) and we hugged. Neil, we chatted about how awesome it is to be born in November, and Amanda, I thanked you for the show and complimented your uke skills. You guys are just fantastic. The show had run too long and you guys stayed behind to meet some of the people that came to see you, and even though everything was so rushed, you stayed anyway, and I think that's really fucking cool. I still have the flowers from the stage. So, thanks for being so awesome. You also wrote me a haiku about bananas on my Kickstarter cardboard CD holder thing, because I asked you to.

Thanks for being awesome.  \n\nAmanda, \nYou've been one of my heroes for nearly ever. I do hope to meet you one day.\n\nMy question for both: how do you find time in all the chaos? Do you two ever get to disappear together and just focus on each other? Similarly, how the hell do you find space to create anything new without all the amazing things you've already done creeping in?", "Neil - Your writing is fantastic. American Gods was the first book I read where I didn't want to leave the world when I was finished with it.  It made me want to be a writer. Not that I'm any good but I definitely intend to try.\n\nAmanda - I have very strange friends with interesting tastes in music and because of that I have to say thank you for writing some of that interesting music.  Some of your stuff just puts a smile on my face when I hear it.\n\nWhat drew the two of you into your fields?  Like what was the defining moment where you decided that Neil wanted to be a writer and Amanda wanted to be a performer?\n\nI can't wait to be able to get the bundle.

Did you feel like it held up the integrity of your novel?\n\nAmanda, I've always admired how close you are to your fans and how genuine you are with them. Do you find that this level of closeness allows your music to have more of an impact on people? Do you ever feel that you share too much of your personal life/emotions with them?", "Neil, I've noticed a kind of anti-relationship theme in some of your novels. Most fresh in my mind is Neverwhere. The protagonist has a girlfriend who you take pains to make into a caricature of a harpy, a ball and chain. I'd suggest you don't like women, but you have had some marvelous female characters in your various works.

I first picked it up 14 years ago during a particularly difficult period in my life while searching for something to escape into, and I immediately fell in love with the both the relatable characters as well as the peculiar realm of London Below. To this day, this is still my favorite novel and the first I recommend to anyone looking for a good read.\n\nSecond: Do you still keep in contact with Tori Amos? As a fan of both of yours, it was always nice to see the admiration you shared towards one another pop up once in a while in your projects. ", "Hi Neil! The first book I ever read to my son was \"Instructions\". He was about 5-6 months old.

You're both wonderful. \n\nA real question, to justify the post. I love the way you both play with language, I especially like the visceral enjoyment Amanda conveys with her lyrics and the more subtle rhythms that Neil uses.

It began a line of thought and action which ended in [my debut EP](http://brianmccormick.bandcamp.com). Thank you.\n\nNeil. Your worlds are some of the most beautiful I've had the pleasure of exploring. They've fueled my imagination and inspired me as a writer. Thank you.\n\n", "Not really a question, but just a weird coincidence, as a huge fan of Neil, and in recent years, Amanda, I was reminded that long before I ever really listened to The Dresden Doll's, the song Ultima Esperanza was apparently written about a friend of mine.

Have you thought of doing a Nirvana covers album?", "Neil - \nNo question, just a tid bit.  \nMy daughter recently turned 5, and my grandmother - almost 92 asked me for a book title to send for her birthday.   I told her \"Crazy Hair by Neil Gaiman\" which I had recently discovered after finishing Ocean at the End of the Lane in a quest for MORE Neil Gaiman.  She asked - \"Would a Neil Gaiman book be appropriate for a 5 year old?\"  I was shocked that she knew of your work, but even more floored when she then told me that you were one of her favorite authors.  After reading reviews of your children's titles, she found it hard to decide which to send and which to keep for herself!  \nSo there you go - from 5 to 92 with me in the middle.  Thank you for a common thread.  And for the record, my daughter loves her new copy of Crazy Hair.", "I know I'm a bit late to the party, but just wanted to say thank you to Neil Gaiman (and Amanda Palmer, big Dresden Dolls fan) for being an amazing human being. \n\nAround 6 or 7 years ago, Neil, you were in Arkansas answering questions and doing a panel at Hendrix College. My friend and I drove all day to see you, and were some of the last to leave your talk. We were standing outside in the cold with giant blankets after your talk ended and no one else was around. We had been waiting for over an hour for our friend to come pick us up. You walked over to us and offered us a ride home. We didn't take you up on it (too nervous and scared we'd be an inconvenience) but I never got the chance to tell you how much I appreciated your offer. Not many celebrities would take the time to help our their fans. Thank you so much, Neil! \n\nP.S. Thanks for writing LGBTQ characters.

I just got through reading Alan Moore's Lost Girls and the artistic style and general feel of the work reminded me alot of your Sandman Stuff (which i loved). The difference of course is that the focus of Lost girls is almost entirely on the erotic.

How can we help preserve freedom?", "There are many important and intrusive aspects of the IP chapter for ordinary citizens.  One of the first ones that springs to my mind, perhaps because of the recent controversy in the United States, concerns cell phone unlocking.  If the United States proposal is accepted, there would be no way to make a permanent exception to the circumvention of a technological protection measure (a \"digital lock\") to unlock your cell phone and allow you to take your phone from one carrier to another, even when your service contract has expired.  To do so would violate what the United States has proposed in the TPP.  There are many examples of how digital locks have been used inappropriately and resulted in unintended consequences for the everyday citizen.  EFF has a great paper called the \"Unintended Consequences: 15 Years Under the DMCA\" on this issue.\n\nWith respect to providing feedback, it's difficult to do without knowing what's in the TPP so we're fortunate to have had a leak of the text.  However, it is important to push for greater transparency because we have not had many leaks and there are many chapters that could affect ordinary citizens that we have not seen yet.  The secrecy is an undemocratic process and citizens should fight back against it.", "One of the greatest challenges around the TPP has been to get access to the text - and to tell people exactly what's in it. Kristay hit the nail on the head - we need more transparency. Only then will we have accountability. So as citizens, we need to stand together and amplify our voices to ensure these backdoor deals don't get through. Preserve freedom by raising your voices! There are many ways. For one, you can  join over 120,000 people who have said no to the TPP's Internet Censorship Plan (https://OpenMedia.org/Censorship). You can also share your opinions directly as a letter to the editor in your local newspaper (https://openmedia.org/letter) - and always make sure to spread the word so your friends, family, and networks know about the TPP.

I know the process is shrouded in secrecy, but is your understanding that the idea is to finalize the draft treaty in Singapore? If so, there's a limited amount of time to impact change.

But even if they finalize and sign it at either of those meetings, we can still fight it from getting ratified by our countries.\n\nAs maimz said, we're part of an international coalition of groups fighting back against TPP's draconian copyright enforcement provisions called [Our Fair Deal](http://ourfairdeal.org). Our strategy is to get as many people aware of TPP's grossly undemocratic process as possible, and stop our elected representatives from binding our laws to this corporate wishlist of policies.

I have three guesses as to why tech companies been quiet on the copyright enforcement provisions: \n\n1) Since the TPP is a trade agreement that covers wide-range of regulatory issues, it could be that they don't want to come out against it so they don't want to step on any toes by seeming like they're \"anti-trade.â\n\n2) They're pushing for provisions in another chapter on âE-Commerceâ on the topic of data flows. There hasn't been a leak of this yet so we don't know its exact terms, but it threatens to carry language that treats user privacy laws like trade barriers. It could have fishy language that undermines protections for users to control their own data. Companies want to be able to do what they want with users' information since that's what they sell and trade for profit.\n\n3) Many of those companies already have existing copyright takedown systems, may not want to put themselves on the line for the above reasons. But we feel that they should be challenging these laws, especially because the âintermediary liabilityâ provisions unfairly puts the onus on them to privately enforce copyright. While we have some pretty good protections for those companies here in the U.S. (i.e. the safeharbor protections) we've already seen tons of problems where content is taken down and users are censored due to a system that incentivizes over-caution by these companies liable for their users' infringement.", "What needs to be done to stop this from getting passed?

Although I don't know if it would happen this way, a couple countries could decide not to be a part of the TPP anymore and in that sense, less than the current 12 countries would be needed.  In the United States, once it is passed through Congress (regardless of the final number of countries and regardless of the track under which Congress approves it), it will be legally binding on the United States and enforceable.", "Unfortunately, that part of the process (the lobbyist access) has little to do with determining how legally binding it is.  In the US, it needs approval of Congress (it's not considered a treaty -- which would require 2/3 Senate approval), but rather a \"trade agreement\" which requires majority of both Houses of Congress approval.  If that happens (and enough other countries agree to it as well), then it becomes a binding agreement.  While, in theory, Congress can then pass laws that violate the agreement there are significant consequences for doing so.\n\nThis is, in part, why Congress should not give the USTR fast track (or \"trade promotion\") authority.

You have to remember that ten to fifteen years ago, there was a very strong sentiment in international circles that more IP was better IP -- that the fiercer enforcement was, the longer copyright terms were, and the more sectors were covered by IP law, the richer everyone would become. The overpowering narrative was countries like the US saying \"you better 'improve' your IP law, or we'll not grant you good trade breaks.\"\n\nThat's changing, and it's changing partly because of groups like EFF, KEI, Public Citizen, OpenMedia + many others sitting down with negotiators and explaining how maximalist IP rules can actually damage economies, and smother emerging industries; how actually the economic and creative giants and Internet startups of the US and elsewhere grew out the permissions of copyright, not its restrictions.\n\nIt's slow work, but it's not impossible. Negotiators are getting cannier.

For instance, looking at 1994 and comparing it to 2011, you find that research commitments rose from 2.1% to 2.4% for OECD members. While this may not seem like much, it is the equivalent to 220 billion dollars. Subsequently, for developing countries, this is the same case.

There is plenty of reasons to suggest that it is the flexibilities, not the necessity of stronger protections, that have often lead to better development in those countries.\n\nAs for why greater IP rights is a bad thing -- that's rather basic economics.  You are taking something that is abundant (high in supply), and directly limiting its availability.

Also, the longer you're on a form of birth control, the risk further decreases over time.\n\nObesity, sedentary life-style and smoking makes your risk go up just as much, or more than birth control.\n\nSo, someone who is overweight, &gt;40 years old, smokes and isn't active already has lots of risk, so adding more to that with a CHC might be a bad idea, and would be better served with other options.\n\nProgesterone only forms of birth control (the depo-provera shot) or the IUDs do not appear to increase risk of any of this.\n\nSOGC guidelines: http://sogc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gui252CPG1012E.pdf", "Thank you for this splendid explanation. When I first read the title, I was thinking, \"Come on!\" The title alluded to an issue with NuvaRing, not merely an increased risk associated with all forms of CHC.

One of the most common principles for clots is called \"Virchow's Triad\", which consists of the three factors that increase the chance of developing a clot: stasis (which is, as you pointed out, can be sluggish circulation), endothelial injury (blood vessel wall damage), and hypercoagulable states (blood itself contains stuff which is going to encourage clotting). Birth control affects that last part.\n\nWithout going too much into detail, your combined hormonal contraceptives contain estrogen, and estrogen acts on the liver. As a result, one of the key functions of the liver is the production of multiple proteins including lipoproteins, binding proteins, and other clotting factors. Estrogen increases this production. With more of these pro-clotting factors in the bloodstream, you can see why embolisms become more common!\n\nTL;DR: Estrogen from birth control acts on the liver and causes increased clotting factor production.", "I have been using Nuva ring for four years with absolutely no complaints.

Yes, pain during intercourse is a symptom of endometriosis.

It is important to know symptoms vary from woman to woman and if you think you may have this you need to talk with your GYN ASAP. Please don't let it fester. The only way to be accurately diagnosed is with a laparoscopy where it can be seen visually. There are options available so it can be treated but not cured. I am 37 y/o and have stage IV and have dealt with it for years. Continuous BCP after a few laparoscopies to remove the endometriosis and scar tissue has been the best course for me.

My wife has moderate endometriosis, and had laparoscopic surgery to excise it. It doesn't help with fertility (we've been trying 2+ years) but it is supposed to greatly suppress the effects and symptoms, especially as you get older and it progresses. She opted not to do it because as a nurse, she's become very averse to the use of drugs and hormones to treat things, and it does have some side effects. You're also not supposed to get pregnant on it. However, I just thought I'd mention it to you because from what I understand, it can be very effective. I (vicariously) understand how much endo sucks, and I wish you the best.", "Also do you know if your doctor excised the endometriosis or just cauterized it?  If it isn't completely cut out, it can return very quickly. I also have dealt with endometriosis and sadly found it after my first laparoscopy that the doctor did not cut it out which explains why my pain came back so quickly (within a few months). \n\nI don't know where you are located, but there are some very good endometriosis specialists scattered about.\n\nAnd I would definitely stay away from\nLupron!

There's a short window after surgery where pregnancy is much more likely, and we did conceive the first cycle after; she miscarried at 10 weeks (baby died at 7). According to the doc, pregnancy is the best treatment to suppress endo, so I'm hoping that did set it back some. But I'm also worried that now it may be starting to come back as it's been over 4 months since the surgery.\n\nAnd yeah, there's no way she'll be going on Lupron just because of how she feels about using drugs, but she does have a coworker that used it and it worked well for her. I think it's one of those things where the results and side effects can vary widely.", "If he used the word \"excise\" then it sounds like he attempted to cut it all out. However, it also depends a lot on the surgeon's skill (excising is much more difficult laparoscopically and sometimes endo can be hard to detect, I.e. It can have many different appearances). \n\nI just had a hysterectomy at 32 because I was tired of living with the pain (I also had adenomyosis in addition to endometriosis).

One of my best friends has the implant (I'm Irish, we call it the bar over here) and loves everything about it apart from the fact that she gets really irregular periods. But it actually saved her money because she got it in and doesn't have to buy pills every month. Good luck with your decision!

I've never had to put this down on paper before, and writing it down keeps triggering other things I want to add. The result is very ad-hoc.\n\nMy wife started dealing with endo pains 10 years ago when she was 19, but didn't know what it was until 21.\n\nShe did every birth control out there, tried chemical menopause via Lupron shots, and nothing would improve the quality of her life. Lupron helped, but gave her terrible migraines, and the constant screwing with her hormones nearly killed her libido and made things pretty rough for her emotionally.\n\nFlash forward to this year. She's had several laparoscopic surgeries to clean everything up in the 10 year voyage, the most recent being 2 years ago. During that procedure they stuck the IUD in to see if that would work. It helped initially by effectively reducing all period stuff by 99% - occasional spots... but then the cysts came - a common side effect of the IUD. She also was still suffering from a severely suppressed libido.\n\nA few months later, the pain from cysts forced her to get the rid of the IUD. With no other options, and plenty of pain, she made the election to finally have a hysterectomy performed. That was about 4-5 months ago. We were lucky to have been working with an amazing Doctor (Dr. Hogen, works for Kaiser in the Portland/Metro area) who was willing to do it knowing that she had tried all other options. He told us afterwards that as they removed the uterus tubes, etc., that they found endo implants that they never would have been able to see or truly get to via the normal laparoscopy procedure. One ovary was literally fused to her bowels with an cyst covered with endo implants. In all of that mess, her other ovary was a shining beacon of hope, like it was surrounded by a force field. The picture is quite weird.\n\nThey opted to leave that ovary in place and cleaned everything else out. Her recovery has been phenomenal. She felt better when she woke up than she had in years, and that has continued to improve. Her mood, libido, and attitude has increased for the better exponentially and sexy time is pain free and often (yessss!).\n\nI'm not suggesting that you go out and get definitive surgery ASAP. Obviously, biological children are off the table (which is a pro in our case, as we weren't interested at all in having kids). If you have to have both ovaries removed you will enter menopause, and early menopause = significant chances of bone density loss and other issues. Basically it's Super-Menopause, so we got lucky there.\n\nWhat I am suggesting is that if your quality life starts to truly suffer that you keep it in mind as a last resort option. Your doctors will tell you a lot of negatives and give a lot of warnings and of course tell you that it may not solve the issue at all - that's what they are supposed to do. You will probably encounter a lot of resistance as we did, and perhaps even doctors telling you that it absolutely won't solve the problem. That's just not true. Keep searching until you find a doctor that is compassionate and understand the condition.\n\nStay strong!", "Thank you very, very much for sharing your story with me! I'm so sorry to hear that about your wife, that does not sound like it is fun at all and I can't even imagine having to suffer through that.

We had not heard about boric acid before.\n\nKirby: Isn't boric acid what you use to kill cockroaches?\n\nJames: In 2014 California is going to change their flammability standard.  Instead of testing chunks of foam against an open flame, which is not real time conditions, the test will become a smolder standard.  And that is a real fire setting.

Worst culprits?", "James here: speaking on the topic of flame retardants in upholstered furniture, that's what we specifically focused on.\n\nKirby here: flame retardant products that are added to products made out of polyurethane foam.  They are found in most upholstered home furniture and many baby products (nap pads, changing pads, some not all breast feeding pillows, and some baby mattresses).

There are thousands of research papers that point to things like thyroid problems, adrenal problems, neurological and learning disabilities, some cancers are linked to these chemicals.\n\nKirby: Some studies are linking them to autism. And they are very close to being able to prove the negative effects to firefighters, because when the chemicals burn they become dioxin, and we are seeing increased levels in firefighters of very rare cancers normally found in the chemical industry. San Francisco has the highest level of female firefighters, and we are seeing 6 times the rate of breast cancer in the 40-50 year old females as opposed to the same female group that is not in the firefighting field.

And if this is all true, I'll paraphrase my usual response to anti vaxxers: I'd rather have an autistic child than one dead in a house fire.\n\nEdit: I realise I may sound rude, and I don't intend to. There may be a lot of value in this documentary. But given the amount of panic about autism and the vast amount of damage that panic has done to public health, I feel these guys are being irresponsible making statements like that.", "&gt; Kirby: Some studies are linking them to autism\n\nPlease link all of these studies.", "Yep, all credibility out the window. \n\nEvery to ensure someone wants to warrant sympathy for their crusade against something, they imply a causal relationship between that thing and autism.

For example, the wet chemical systems used for commercial cooking wouldn't be useful in a large warehouse (an automatic sprinkler system with early suppression fast response heads would be best there). ", "Kirby: Oh definitely.  Sprinklers, smoke detectors, fire alarms and reduction in smoking.\n\nJames: Co2 detectors too.\n\nKirby: Your question is excellent because one of the characters in our film said the methods of controlling fire have always been toxic, questionable to our health. Asbestos was a favored flame retardant for a period of time.\n\nJames: By the way, flame retardants CAN work if you use enough of them.  Aeronautics, hospital and prison settings.  There are certain commercial / institutional settings like NASA where the standard is high. But to use that much in our homes, it makes the foam product hard and very expensive.  And that's why flame retardants only work in higher quantities than we use as consumers.  Your airplane seat and a seat aboard the space shuttle are effectively retardant but it probably cost thousands to make.  \n\nKirby:  The items that you will be able to buy after 2014 when this regulation have been changed will still be safe and flame retardant.  They still will have to pass fire-safety standards. They just won't have flame retardants in the foam in the center of the article.

Be prepared if you are doing a controversial documentary to spend a lot of time, money and energy on fact checking.  ESPECIALLY if you want it broadcast.\n\nJames: Documentaries tend to be less expensive to make but take longer to make. The production teams tend to be smaller and more manageable and you don't have actors.", "Some of my text books write that 70 hours of footage = 1 hour on film is a very lean production proportion, what have you guys found you have run at while filming Toxic HotSeat??", "James: well we did not have a high ratio, because we were just catching things as they went.  \n\nKirby:  We are going to ask our editor right now.  I think we were a 1o-to-1 editor. The more footage you shoot in the field, the longer your editing time will be. \n\nJames: This was not a verite film.

UCLA?\n\nJames: USC, UCLA, and SVA here in New York along with NYU. \n\nKirby: One caveat I would say is that going to grad school for film does not necessarily equate getting a job.\n\nJames: My advice would be to get a PA-type job, and kick around at it for awhile to see if you like it. \n\nKirby: Sometimes you learn as much during the job as you do during school.

These chemicals have been shown in multiple studies to be harmful with little to no benefit and I long for the day that they will be banned from use. Either way, I would rather have a choice on whether or not to introduce these chemicals into my home and around my family, not be forced to be around them in case of a statistically unlikely house fire. \n\nNote to readers: In a house fire, the majority of people are injured or killed due to smoke inhalation, not being burned, so it doesn't matter if the couch took 3 seconds longer to catch on fire.

So we decided to put chlorinated tris (which is a flame retardant) in children's pajamas.  Meanwhile, there was a study done in Berkeley that found that these chemicals were mutagenic, and in 1975-1977, they were removed.  \n\nKirby: Low and behold, these chemicals were not banned, and through efforts by the tobacco lobby to have furniture fire safe instead of having firesafe cigarettes (all 50 states have self-extinguishing firesafe cigarettes, now by the way).  Rather than worrying about the ignition, they said to worry about the source! So rather than change the cigarette, we changed the world around the cigarette. And there it stayed for nearly 40 years.  Even though we have firesafe cigarettes and electronic cigarettes.\n\nJames: One of the things you hear is how fire deaths have gone down since chemical flame retardants were put in furniture, but in reality, the reduction in fire deaths have been related to reduction in smoking and better protection of our homes with fire alarms and water sprinklers being installed in commercial buildings.  Other measures have reduced fire deaths, not flame retardants. ", "The average piece of upholstered furniture is in use for 30 years.  So a piece of furniture will be around for 30 years and the chemicals will leak for the entire life of the product, as the foam decays.

IIRC, furnished rentals in the UK are not allowed to have furniture manufactured between the 1960's and 1970's for the chemicals used to treat the composite materials. If so, is there a link between the policies of the two governments' approaches to the chemical uses?", "Have you ever directed a movie?

No, I'm not a lightning expert, I just spent some time researching what lightning does when it hits water.\n\nBasically: when lightning hits water, it dissipates the entire energy of the bolt over a roughly 6m radius area â almost entirely on the surface of the water. It generates about 260dB (SPL) of sound/shockwave in the water and that much energy can instantly boil a small area of water creating a mist-like spray up into the air and and a splash at the focal point where enough water vaporises.\n\ntl;dr Yes it will make a splash â maximum of 6m radius (not huge)\n\n**Edit** The splash is unimpressive compared to the lightning strike itself. By comparison it can look very small. How small? The following clip contains 5 very small lightning strikes in quick succession and the biggest splash any makes is about half a metre in diameter.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqU4ondg3L8\n\nDid you catch it?

It's almost less impressive than the vapour trail the lightning made through the rain above it. Despite the large looking impact point (mostly caused by vaporising/ionising the rain and surface mist on the lake), the little lightning bolt's energy was only concentrated enough right at its centre to vaporise the water in the lake itself.

All living creatures (hot- or cold-blooded) generate some heat (due to Laws of Thermodynamics)\nGenerate CO2? Yes\n", "Larry seemed to be implying that algae are a significant source of heat and an overall net surplus generator of atmospheric CO2,\n\nI was thinking they cycle CO2.\n\nBy using photosynthesis to capture CO2, produce oxygen and store carbon, and release the carbon back as CO2 from bacterial decomposition, or get eaten by fish and farted out.\n\nAlternately, the fish droppings could leave much of the carbon on the ocean floor to be eaten by algae again or stored in sediment.\n\n", "All plants generate CO2, and yes cycle them but slightly different to what you are thinking. 'Eating' for plants, including algae, is not only about creating sugars but also burning them like we do. \n\nPhotosynthesis creates sugars and uses CO2 and energy from the sun. Respiration is the process of breaking those sugars down to release that energy, producing CO2. Plants can't just create sugars, they must also burn them again to release that energy they have just captured in a form that is USEFUL to plants (Sunlight on it's own is not useful energy, ie the plant can't actually use it to do anything. Burning sugars releases energy in a form plants can use). There is typically a net UPTAKE of carbon however, because it is also incorporated into other building blocks rather than just released straight back out again, allowing them to sequester carbon directly from the atmosphere.\n\nThese algae can then do what you are suggesting as well. They can be stored in the sediment, capturing carbon. Or they can be eaten by other organisms, and the other organisms now burn their stored sugars (and other components) releasing the CO2 back. \n\nNow that said, the easiest thing I can think of to debunk that crazy you linked to is this: Algae are plants, they require light to survive. Why on earth would they live in great sheets on the bottom of the ocean where there is no light?

Why?", "&gt; when I do a stretch on the first attempt I can get to a certain point, after then immediately relaxing, then going back into the stretch I can reach further\n\nYou are \"standing on the shoulders of giants\" - stretching on top of a previous stretch (when then becomes the new baseline\"", "The answer to this is that flexibility is primarily a function of the nervous system, not the physical length of muscles. If I were to put you under anaesthetic, you would be significantly more flexible than you are now.  \n\nWe need some basics of neuroscience to understand how this works.  Your brain keeps a bodymap in the somasensory cortex and the motor cortex, the latter being more relevant in this situation. Basically, this is an image the brain has of the body and its capacity to function.  This is a learned image, based almost entirely on your past actions and habits. A good example is the foot.  There are muscles present that are almost the same as the hand, so technically we should have the same movement capacity in the toes as the fingers, that is we should be able to move single toes on their own without moving other toes, in almost all directions.  Most of us can't do this however, because we wear shoes and rarely use our toes.  This means our body map of our toes is very vague, and treats it almost like there was only one large toe. It is also very important to note that these maps are plastic.  This means they are constantly updating themselves with new information.  So if you decided to start practicing wiggling your toes individually today, every day for a few hours, then in a few months the maps would have updated enough to have almost full control back. It goes both ways too, if you stop using your toes again, the maps would begin to degrade until your toes are out of your control once more.\n\nFlexibility is the same.  If you don't use a particular range of motion, then the maps to that range of motion degrade, and you are not able to activate the muscles properly and control movement or have any strength in extended ranges of motion that you dont use.  Adding onto this is the stretch reflex, which is basically the driving force behind all human movement. In the case of flexibility, it also acts as a protective mechanism.  As you approach an unfamiliar part of your body map, the nervous system detects that you lack ability to maintain strength and control, and acts to protect the joint by contracting the muscles that are being stretched and preventing them from going any further, and this effect is exponential as you move closer to your end range of motion. If you do this very quickly or with a lot of weight that pulls you into a range of motion you're extremely unfamiliar with, the muscles can contract so hard that they can tear themselves or surrounding connective tissues resulting in an injury.\n\nIf however, you just go near to your end range of motion and spend a bit of time there, even in a few seconds the body maps are already starting to update. So when you go out and then come back the body map is already updated and allows you to go past this \"new familiar\" area and further into unfamiliar territory.\n\nI actually wrote an article on this subject recently which you can see here:\nhttp://awarerelaxedconnected.com.au/flexibility-mobility-and-range-of-motion-basics/\n\nedit: a word", "Wow, I never thought that it would be based so heavily around the nervous system.

Consider that there are several inkspots, one of which is us. If the baloon is being inflated, then *all* the inkspots are moving away from each other. Therefore we would see all the inkspots moving away from us. But this is true of every other inkspot as well... There is no \"centre\" of expansion in the 2D space of the surface of the balloon.\n\nIn a similar manner, there is no centre of expansion in 3D space of the universe.

I also agree with you about the pressure they anticipated from the political realm but I do think, and maybe it's easy for me to say as my job isn't on the line, but that these are the times when people have to stand up to those in power.  On their website the museum says that (http://naturalsciences.org/about-us): \n\"Humanity is embedded within nature and we are at a critical moment in the continuity of time. Our collections are the direct scientific evidence for evolution and the ecological interdependence of all living things. The human species is actively altering the Earthâs natural processes and reducing its biodiversity. As the sentient cause of these impacts, we have the urgent responsibility to give voice to the Earthâs immense story and to secure its sustainable future.\"\nI really do think that if they cave to the legislature then they're neither fulfilling their mission nor providing the public service they're funded to provide.  Climate science isn't a matter of opinion, and when major scientific institutions run from the conversation it gives validity to the idea that it's either not real or relevant.  ", "I agree with you in principal, however, there is a practical reality to the Museum retaining funding.  They have very good exhibits on climate change and the environment in the museum.  It would be a shame if those exhibits had to suffer because reactionaries decided the Museum should no longer get funds to  support those exhibits.  Aside from not showing your movie, the museum does make many efforts to educate the public on climate and the environment.  I do not agree with their decision and am upset about it.  Your right that a political agenda should not drive the facts or science of an issue.   However, I understand their decision in light of the political environment in NC. \n\nThank you for your work on this issue.  I apologize for what I consider my Museum's decision.  I look forward to seeing the movie. ", "Well, no need to apologize of course and I'm glad to hear they do have exhibits that are focused on climate change as they absolutely should.  I get the practical issues, and I'm not being a Pollyanna about the realities of funding, but I do think this was a poorly thought out decision.  If the Director's rationale was they would have wanted a panel discussion with people from different perspectives I would have agreed to that in a second...actually, that's essentially what we proposed.  So clearly there's something else going on here and we should at least have the conversation.  Maybe some of the political pressure to suppress science will be exposed in this process, and that could be a positive thing.

First there's the process of just finding the kernel of a story, and in this case the film was about Long Beach Island, surfing and the Army Corps of Engineers.  Even before that it was inspired by my reading John McPhee's \"The Control of Nature\", which led me to look for dynamic places where our engineering efforts are ultimately doomed.  In terms of interviews, some are harder to get than others but for the most part people like to be interviewed, especially when you're talking to people who work in private for most of their lives and are passionate about what they do.   Most people love an audience.  On the other hand, I did run into a couple of scientists in the film who were hesitant to be interviewed at first because they didn't know me and weren't sure of my perspective.

The bigger question for scientists at this point is that the last time we had a climate that was 5-8 degrees warmer (F) - which is where we're heading in the next 100 years - sea levels were 18-27 feet higher than they are today.  You can't account for that from just melting smaller glaciers, some of it had to come from the big ice sheets including Antarctica and Greenland.  Climatologists think/hope that Antarctica is stable, but if it's melted before it could melt again and if it becomes unstable even a small melt could cause a surge in sea levels.  That is a possibility for this century.

My hope is that sooner or later people will realize that building on the edge of the coast is an expensive and un-winnable proposition and that that the very least the government shouldn't be making it cheaper and easier.  That's the irony here, which is that the reason we've so heavily developed so many of these coastal regions has to do with federal subsidies in the form of Flood Insurance and disaster relief.  We've seen where that gets us with Sandy and with sea level rise, and now NC is going to essentially throw out a very sensible and cautious approach to coastal development in favor of encouraging people to develop there.", "What was your inspiration for the film? How long did it take?", "Initially it was two things.  The first was reading John McPhee's the Control of Nature about the attempts to engineer highly dynamic places like the Mississippi River and the unintended consequences that come from that.  That's where I ended up with barrier islands and beach replenishment.  \nThe second inspiration was trying to find someplace where you could see the impacts of climate change happening to illustrate that climate change isn't just something that impacts people thousands of miles away or decades in the future, that it's happening now and here.\nIt took me almost 4 years to make.

There are a lot of good reasons to develop land, and a lot of good people who do.  But there are also other realities to consider and that's what the film's about, so when I found myself talking to people who were just discounting those other considerations I had to press them.  Just as I pressed the people I spoke with who suggested we 'retreat' from the coast.  That's also a tough proposition for most people to accept.", "What's your most substantial criticism of your own work?", "I'd say that because I often come to subjects from an interest in a particular issue or subject, the hardest thing for me to do is to find the right storytelling approach that gives the audience enough of a character hook to move them along through rather complex subjects.  It's very hard to make films that are balanced (as I think mine are) and also commercially successful or viable, but at the end of the day the truth is it doesn't matter what film you make if no one watches it so you have to get good at doing both things at once.", "Hi! This film is really intriguing and I think that it really draws some attention to important environmental issues but as someone who is interested in Political Science, if we were to address the issues of construction on the coasts, how would we compensate those who would have to give up their properties? Also, even if we were to stop building along the coastlines and trying to salvage the beaches in conflict with nature's course, how would we be able to prevent the coasts from eroding even further? ", "Great question.  I've thought about this and talked with people about it a lot.  The first thing is that instead of plowing all of our money into simply armoring coastal communities there should be permanent funding available for people who can't afford to relocate or rebuild and who WANT to move to retreat from vulnerable areas.  A lot of people, including some of those in the film, bought into beachfront communities a long time ago, have their primary residences there, and didn't realize what they were getting into.  Especially as climate change and sea level rise increase.  That land can then be turned into a buffer zone, a living shoreline, to help absorb storm surges.  But then you also have to consider the towns and cities that would be losing 'ratables' and property tax revenues when those homes are gone and so we would need to rework some parts of the tax code so that those communities didn't get his as hard as they otherwise would be.  No mayor of a small town is going to want his or her community to pick up and leave with the lifeblood of their budget.  \nAs far as how to stop the coasts from eroding...there's really nothing you can do about that.  Some things like beach replenishment can delay the inevitable but as pretty much any geomorphologist will tell you (people who study the coast), if you let the beach erode it isn't going to disappear, it will just move.  But if you have a home, streets, infrastructure, etc. and you hold the line on erosion, eventually you end up with a sea wall and no beach at all.  ", "What do you think is the best way to convince people not to build along the coastline?", "Watch Shored Up? Kidding, though it might be a place to start.  I think if people understand where the coastline was at the end of the last ice age, 20,000 years ago vs. where it is today, that would be a start.  Along the mid-atlantic coast near New Jersey it was 90 miles east of today's coastline.  Of course that seems like a long time, but it's also 1 mile every 200 years.  Which means that when George Washington was a boy it would have been 1 mile east.  On the other hand I lived in a house in Philadelphia that was about as old as George Washington...just one thing to consider.", "Hello, I watched the film the other day and I found it to be extremely beneficial. I am a Florida Native and live by the coast. I often see the destruction caused by mother nature. I think that many people are unaware at the level of degradation the ocean causes to our beach front.

First is land subsidence which along most of the mid-atlantic coast doubles the relative sea level rise you mentioned to total between 3-4 mm per year which means up to 16 inches a century. That's without considering any acceleration in sea level rise and doesn't factor in the scientific consensus of the overwhelming majority of scientists who study this - that sea level rise is accelerating in many places (not everywhere or by the same amount) and will accelerate dramatically in the next century.  The thermal expansion of the oceans is basic physics, the bigger question is how much land-based glacial melt is coming and when.  But even if you must ignore all of this, should we be taking places like barrier islands and low lying coastline which by their very nature are highly dynamic i.e. constantly moving, and trying to harden them into place when we know that it will never work and will cost many taxpayer dollars and lives? ", "Well I do not want this to become a fundamental scientific debate here, since even though I study Geography, the topic itself is just too big to cover. Regarding subsidence and erosion of coastlines â yes this is a natural phenomenon that one must consider, but as far as I know there are no studies concerning a dangerous new trend in this topic.\nMoreover 1.5mm/year is no figure you can just take and calculate the sea level for 2100 with.  Sea levels do not rise with a steady rate for some decades or so, not as far as science knows. Sea levels oscillate.\nHave a look at [this](http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/04/23/nicola-scafetta-major-new-sea-level-study-finds-c21st-rise-likely-to-be-less-than-a-foot/) maybe.\nThermal expansion is indeed basic physics, but this basic physic is more reliant for solids and not as easily to transport for fluids, since evaporation plays a huge part here. More evaporation means more clouds. More clouds will lead to a higher albedo and more rain of course. The role of the clouds in our climate system is still not fully understood (not that the rest is ;) ) so there can be no 100%-sure predictions. \n[Here](http://www.c3headlines.com/sea-levels.html) are just some more figures.

If so, please provide evidence. All I know is that horror scenarios are more often published than âeverything-will-be-ok-so-donât-worry-too-muchâ-storys. \n\nTo answer you question from your last paragraph: I do believe human shortsightedness is the biggest problem in itself.

Every species adapts to its surrounding area. Humans do thisâ¦.in a special and sometimes not natural(!) way.\nSo no, money should not be the mean to maximize the time for someone to live in an area that is inhospitable.

There are a number of online communities, and some cities even have meetups.

There are also a lot of places to explore, including ancient ruins and towns.\n\nI wouldn't call Windforge a Wilderness survival game, it's probably closer to the Elder Scrolls games (like Skyrim) where you are placed into a sandbox world, and given a story and quests.\n\nWhen you start the game you will be thrown into the narrative and given quests and goals to accomplish.  We are developing these as much as possible to give you reasons to harness your freedom and creativity, without restricting it.  The constraints and challenges of the world are also designed to work in conjunction with this.\n\nI try to design quests and the world to give you high level goals, and let you figure out how to best accomplish them.  For example, if you have the goal of finding an artifact in the lower atmosphere, you will need to figure out how to survive in the poisonous gas, construct a ship suitable for such an environment, explore ancient ruins for the artifact, defend yourself while you explore, and so on.  \n\nI don't want to give any spoilers, but some crazy stuff is going to happen as you progress through everything :)", "Do you have any cool stories you can share about unexpected things to happen to you during your testing of Windforge?", "Cool, yeah.  Windforge can be unpredicable at times, so there were definitely things that happened that were unexpected.  Showing the game at conferences like PAX was great for this.\n\nA lot of my favourite stories involved the whales.  For instance, some guy at the show figured out that he could mine an island really quickly by aggravating whales and getting them to break the blocks for him.  I was pretty excited when he showed this to me, since it was a clever idea that was really effective, and was also balanced out really well by the fact that angry whales are really dangerous.\n\nWhales plowing through the corpses of dead whales in order to attack you was also surprising, and sort of disturbing.  \n\nPropellers also cause a lot of chaotic behavior that I find a lot of fun.  For example, we have a video where I rammed my ship into an enemy ship.  This caused the wall to break, and the nearby propeller from my ship sucked a few of the enemies out.  \n\nThe list could probably go on.  There are a lot of cool emergent behaviors that can happen in Windforge.  Some of these are by design, and some have come by surprise.  I have a feeling there are a bunch that we haven't found yet either :)", "Last time I saw the game it had big FPS issues. Have you guys already identified the areas that require the most optimization?\n\n", "I'm not sure when you last saw the game, but we have done some significant optimizations.  Unfortunately, most of these were done after most of the conferences we showed the game at.  \n\nThere are still a bunch of places that we are planning to optimize.  We would like to get our min specs down as much as we can. ", "we are doing a game project using unity 3D. Do you have any advices about the program or is there another program we can use that you think is better?\n", "I've used Unity 3D a bit, but I'm not super experienced with it, so I probably shouldn't give advice for how to use it :) \n\nUnity is great though, and it is very popular, so there should be a lot of resources out there to help you get started.  It should be a good choice if it is suitable for your game.  If you're game is 3D it's the first thing that pops into my head that I can recommend.  If it's 2D there are also other tools like flash or Game Maker.  \n(unfortunately, I don't have much experience with these either)", "Thank you very much for your time. It is good to hear that Unity 3D is the first thing that pops into your head. So this means we are on the right track :)", "What inspired you to get into game design?", "Game design is a lot of fun and really rewarding.  I find it really satisfying to take ideas and extrapolate them and their repercussions to absurd places :)\n\n(Note: It's also a lot of work, takes a lot of experience, and involves a lot of hard decisions.   (hopefully this isn't discouraging))\n\nI'd say game design is something I've been interested in since I started playing games.  \n\nI got started professionally though as a programmer, and then I transitioned into game design.   I still do a significant amount of programming too, and I think it's helpful to understand algorithms if you are a designer. (Games are all about algorithms.)", "I want to buy your game simply from your description.", "Thanks!", "The game looks great and the art looks amazing too. Reminds me a lot of Terraria. It seems like the art for the creatures doesn't really match the art for the environments and the player made content but maybe that's intentional. The gameplay does look sweet and I've been waiting for steampunk themed game for a long time so thanks for making this, I'll get my friends to greenlight it :)", "Thanks a lot!  I'll pass the feedback on to our artists.  \n\nOur kickstarter would be nice to share too.  (if you don't mind of course):  http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/snowedinstudios/windforge", "What kind of guns can u use in the game? ", "There are a variety of weapons and items in the game.  (we currently have more than 500).   These vary between items you can craft and build with, to items you can use like weapons.   If you are creative enough, you could also use the building materials in battle in a number of ways.\n\nFor actual weapons there are an assortment of knives, jackhammers, pistols, rifles, mini-guns, and throwing items.\n\nCurrently, the grappling hook is my favourite item in the game.  This isn't technically a weapon, but I find it very useful in battle.\n\nOh yeah, there are also a variety of ship mounted weapons too.  There are a variety of turrets and grinders.", "It seems like this is a pretty expansive universe from the gameplay videos. How do you make sure that the \"epic storyline\" remains unbroken by players' individual choices throughout the gameplay? Is this something that you can easily plan for in advance or does it take hours and hours of rigorous play testing to provide insight on the design mechanisms of the story?", "I try to design for this as much as possible, although I think rigorous play testing will also be necessary.  \n\nWhenever possible I try to give the players higher level goals from the story, and let them approach the goals in the manner they like.  I also try to to avoid cases where I tell the player \"How\" to do something, because this can get in the way of creativity, and also be hard to evaluate at times.    \n\nI also like the idea of enabling players to come up with their own goals and solutions, based on the constraints and challenges of the world.  For example, we have different environment types that are designed to be both interesting and give you reasons to construct your ships in different ways.  For example, the upper atmosphere has periodic meteor showers that can be very dangerous.  There are a number of strategies for surviving effectively up there, and a few of them involve constructing your ships in different ways.  (like avoiding giant balloons, fire resistant materials, etc.)\n\nWe have had to add a few special cases to the game to make it so you can't destroy the main story, like if you completely destroy an important town, etc, but luckily these are pretty limited.\n", "What were the main inspirations for the storyline?", "The story line has evolved a lot since we start making the game.  The more we developed the game the more the strengths of the game became apparent, and so we evolved the story to play on these strengths.  One of the things that people really latched onto in Windforge was the skywhales (and also the fact that you can mine them to harvest meat and blubber).  \n\nBecause of this I gave the whales a central place in the fiction of the world and also in the premise of the story.  Whale oil is the predominant energy source in Windforge (it's a whale oil based economy),  but because of this whales are now in danger of becoming extinct.  The story starts with you being hired to research a forbidden technology, in order to replace whale oil as an energy source.  \n\nI don't want to give away spoilers about the story, but the premise of it is explained in detail on along with pictures on our kickstarter if you want to check it out:  http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/snowedinstudios/windforge\n\nI find the themes of this premise interesting and relevant, and it there are a lot of possible directions to explore that come out of it.  It will also hopefully balance out the claims that the game is \"about slaughtering whales\".\n\n", "Just one question. Will there be bombs?... Really big ones cause i wanna blow up a whale....", "Yes, there are definitely bombs in the game, and also some pretty massive explosions.  The biggest explosion in the game right now comes from these giant fireballs that rise out of the core of the world.  These are big enough to destroy a ship in one hit.\n\nSome of the bombs in the game will be thrown like grenades, and others can be placed in the world.  For instance, you can place oil barrels on the ground and shoot them to trigger an explosion.  Chain reactions are also possible, which are a lot of fun :)\n", "You should add flying seals, and fish (generic fish). On right, my question...\nDo you like fish, and cute, fluffy seals?", "Cool, I think seals would be a lot of fun :)  What's not to like about fish, and cute, fluffy seals?", "You could have seals appear in hordes, that way you have to fight multiples at one time.\n\nAlso a giant Mecha-Whale would be COOL", "I love the idea of whales in the sky and them being a power source. The background reminds me a lot of that of the movie Atlantis the lost empire or maybe its the overall feel of the game. \n\n", "Thanks, a lot!", "Hi! I've been following the game for a while and somewhere I remember seeing that you wanted to add the possibility of taming some of the creatures in the game? Is this still something you're looking at? It would be cool to teach a sky dolphin (there should be sky dolphins) to tow your damaged ship, or rescue crew mates if they fall out. That last one actually sounds really complicated but I can dream. Anyway, the game looks great and I love the soundtrack. I hope you guys get funding and I'm looking forward to starting the game.", "Cool, thanks a lot!\n\nThose are cool ideas!  Some of them would be really complicated to do :)\n\nThis would probably be too ambitious to do at this point, but I like the idea of using whales to tow your ships.  It would also be really cool to build structures off of whales.  \n\nAs far as taming animals, we probably wont have time to do anything too elaborate, but we will likely make an intelligence perk where you can ride on the back of smaller creatures, attach a rope, and control where the creatures move.  I think this would be a lot of fun and also very useful if you get stranded on an island without a ship.", "That definitely sounds more doable than my suggestions. I would be happy with riding those flying dog things. :)", "But can I mine Wales?", "Maybe you could BUILD Wales and then mine it.", "You can't build whales, but you can build on dead whales.  You can also build out of whales, by using their meat blocks, etc.", "I think Wales was not actually a typo, but a joke. :P\n", "Ha, that's funny I didn't pick up on that :)", "Why would your ship be destroyed", "Yes, of course you can mine whales :)", "looks amazing! love the art\n", "Thanks!", "Have you ever read the Leviathan novels by Scott Westerfeld? They're all about this giant British whaleship trying to stop the steam-mecha Central Powers in World War I. A great steampunk read!", "Is it wrong to feel bad about not being able to donate to your kickstarter?"]["Holy dogshit!  You did Monkey Island?  I am about to fanboy all over you, because that was awesome!  Not just because the music was good, but the way you interthreaded between scenes had never been before!  I mean that was genius! Leitmotifs weren't even a thing.\n\nI don't even have a question but I suppose I should ask one,  hrm.... What is your favorite color?", "Well, to be clear, the music for the Secret of Monkey Island was originally written by Michael Land back in the 90s.  When the game came out, I was in middle school.\n\nHowever, a couple of years ago, LucasArts did a Special Edition version of the game were we redid all of the art and music of the game, recorded voice actors, added sound effects, etc.  I took Michael Land's original score and rerecorded it with live instruments.  The only piece of music I wrote for it was for the Gold Guy animation at the top of the game.  Otherwise, I was more the roll of music arranger and music producer.\n\nMy favorite color is a steely gray-blue.  Amazingly, when my son was born, his eyes are the exact color that is my favorite color.  I thought that was kinda' rad.", "Can I just say, what you guys did by augmenting (what I believe to be) the trumpet in Guybrush and Elaine's theme was absolutely amazing! But why were the string-instruments at the beginning of the song replaced by such a louder one? Was there a specific reason or was it simply a new artistic interpretation of the song?", "\"Guybrush and Elaine\" was a tough track.  Not in terms of it being more complex or anything than the others, but in terms of the difficulties the original orchestration presented.\n\nThe instrumentation for all of the other cues in the game were basically small ensemble stuff: marimba, flutes, recorders, etc.  And then, suddenly, in the middle of the game, there's this one track that starts with a massive string orchestra swell.  It's supposed to be reminiscent of the schmaltzy romantic scores of the silent movie age.\n\nUnfortunately, when I was redoing the music for the Special Edition version, I didn't have the budget to go and get a live string orchestra section to record the cue.  So, I figured I had two options.  First, I could redo the big string orchestra sound but with better sounding samples than they had back in 1990.  It would still, however, sound like samples.  Or, I could change the arrangement.\n\nAs it happened, while I was trying to figure out what I would do with the cue, one weekend my wife and I went out to a mother's day brunch at a local Mexican restaurant.  There was a mariachi band that went from table to table playing these big romantic cues, but they only had 5 guys.  When I heard it, I thought \"oh! There you go! I can keep the spirit of the original cue, but make it big and schmaltzy sounding in a slightly different romantic way!\"  So, I made the cue start with a mariachi band serenading Guybrush and Elaine from the docks.  Does it make sense in a pirate context? Not really.  But I still think it works.", "Wow, that made a lot of sense! It sounds amazing nonetheless, thanks for the answer :D", "You bet.  For those curious, this is [the scene in question](http://youtu.be/oPZ2F5MCNrs).", "I grew up playing Lucasarts games like the Battlefronts and Republic Commando and Knights of the Old Republic. These games are amazing, and are beloved by millions of people, but in the last few years the quality of the games kinda tapered off a little bit. They were still a ton of fun, but they just didn't live up to the old ones for some reason (both critically and commercially). If you feel uncomfortable with this question you don't need to answer, and I certainly mean no offense, but do you have any insight into why this is? Were there outside forces that were pressuring you in certain directions you didn't want to go in?", "Kotaku had an article about the final days at LucasArts and while I suppose I can't say whether it was true or not, I can say that all of my former colleagues were resharing that article around on Facebook for a few days.\n\nThe other thing that's interesting to note is that you mention that you grew up loving Battlefront, RepCom, and KOTOR.  Well, when those games initially came out, there was a big bunch of noise about \"The quality of LucasArts games isn't what it used to be now!\"  I think, for some reason, that there was a kind of 5 year waiting period with SW games.  Whenever a new one came out, people would point to 5 years earlier and say \"Things were better then!\".  Five years later, they'd point to five years past and yell \"Things were better then!\"  So, a lot of it is the perspective of those playing the games and maybe when in their life they played something.", "Are you talking about [this](http://kotaku.com/how-lucasarts-fell-apart-1401731043) article?\nLucasArts' and Ion Storm's last years are frighteningly similar...", "Yes. That's the one. It's pretty grim.", "That's the one.", "I liked the Force Unleashed games as well, I meant more that critically the studio's newer games didn't do particularly well. I read the article, and if what it says is true I can definitely see how developing games there would be difficult. Perhaps critics/consumers weren't as receptive to new SW games because they were almost always different genres with different goals from the ones that came before. Regardless of that, I just want to say I love your work on these games, your soundtracks and scores are some of the only ones that I still remember and love from the games I've played. Thanks for doing that, and I hope to hear more of your music in the future!", "Part of the issue, I believe, is that \"doing well\" is a relative term.  Did Kinect Star Wars do well?  It sold extremely well.  It was the number one Kinect game for a while.  Did it get savaged in the gaming press?  Yes.  Justifiably so?  I don't think so.  It was a game for kids.  It's like trying to say that the Ewoks and Droids cartoons shit all over people's memories of the films because they had characters that acted goofy.  They're different products for different audiences and needed different prisms through which to be viewed.", "I agree with that, it's not fair for the jaded people in the gaming press to tear a kids' game apart. I didn't pay attention to gaming press when the other games I mentioned came out, but I definitely think the newer ones weren't given a fair shake because people couldn't accept something new. The Force Unleashed 2 didn't deserve the hate it got, it was still a lot of fun to play. Were you working on music for 1313 as well? That game looked sick", "I was.  My biggest regret with the closure of LucasArts is that I won't get to finish the score I was writing for 1313.  It was shaping up to be something really special, as was the game.", "It's a shame, we were all enormously excited for that game. Do you have any prospects for the future, in game development or elsewhere?", "I do. :)  I'm going to be okay.  I've been very busy freelancing for the last 3 months straight.  I have a number of things on the horizon, including (shameless plug warning) [Super Roman Conquest](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1314231455/super-roman-conquest-a-3d-side-scrolling-strategy) - if they get their Kickstarter funding.  They're so close.", "Looks pretty sweet. It's good to see some of you guys continuing to work on cool shit. Although I imagine it has to be a pretty huge adjustment to move from a AAA studio like Lucasarts to freelancing. Good luck man, you're clearly really damn good at what you do. I've listened to your music for countless hours playing Lucasarts games, they're just as much Star Wars to me as John Williams' scores. Thanks for your time and for giving real, thoughtful answers.", "Which music piece from one of your games is your favorite? (Link if possible?)", "Ooo.  Man.  That's a tough one to answer, as I'm sure you probably can guess.  I'm a big fan of the Main Title from [Star Wars: The Force Unleashed](http://youtu.be/pe4wzUYzmTA). The game was cranking along in development and we didn't have a main theme for it.  I was working with the very talented composer Mark Griskey and we just couldn't quite get it right.\n\nThere was starting to be a bunch of pressure from the producers and directors on the game to get it in place, and eventually it came down to a situation where I needed to come up with something over my lunch break.  I grabbed a sandwich and, while standing in line, I thought \"Okay, we need a theme with two halves.  The first part has to represent Starkiller's dark nobility, the second half has to represent the evil Sith influence he's grown up with.\"  By the end of lunch, this track was the result.", "Goddammit, I can't hear that theme without hearing David's stupid lyrics.", "I believe the lyrics actually originate from Sam Witwer.  He used to call David up and leave long voice mails where he'd just sing the theme to the words \"You're force unleeeeeeaaashed ... Staarrr Killeeerrr\"", "What would you consider your biggest influences, musically? \n\nWhat music are you listening to lately that you enjoy?\n\nWithout giving away the farm or getting yourself into trouble, can you detail how you came up with the musical approach for Republic Commando?", "1.  It's probably no surprise that John Williams is a huge influence on me.  I grew up in the 70s and 80s and was a huge fan of Star Wars.  I used to listen to the Empire Strikes Back soundtrack on vinyl over and over again as a kid.  But, other than that, I actually draw a lot of influence from pop and rock music.\n\nI think film and game composing lives and dies by the strength of melodies.  As such, I spend a lot of time listening to contemporary music and studying what makes a good hook and what makes a good earworm.  I want my themes to be memorable, to be the kind of thing you can hum along with while playing, and the kind of thing that sticks with you after you put the controller down.  Even if it's for a traditionally more classical group of instruments, like an orchestra, I still want to approach melody writing in a hook-based format.\n\n2. I've been crazy busy since going freelance and haven't had much time for just enjoying listening to things.  The last album I bought was Muse's 2nd Law, but my love of pop hook analysis has had me pretty obsessed lately with Lorde's \"Royals\".\n\n3. For SW: RepCom, the audio lead for the game was Sound Designer and Voice Actor David Collins.  David had put together a music style guide before I was on the project and it referenced things like Viet Nam war films, the movie Aliens, and Event Horizon.  You see, when we set out to make RepCom, it was initially the non-Star Wars Star Wars game.  Make it edgy.  Make it dark.  Make it gritty.  Turn the stormtroopers into heroes.  None of that had been done before and it turned its back on the swashbuckling romanticism of the established SW tone.\n\nSo, I started to look at non-SW instruments, too.  Taiko drums, didgeridoos, chanting male choirs, those kinds of things.  For a while, there wasn't a single note of original SW music or Williams' themes in the game.  After focus testing showed that people didn't think the game was Star Warsy enough, music was one of the things seen as an easy development area to help out moving the needle back towards established SW tone.  So, we put some of the original score back in.  But I worked hard to edit out all of the Jedi themes, hero themes, etc.  The only real SW character theme left in there was the Trade Federation theme.", "If someone is trying to get into game composing, what are some of the things they shouldn't do?\n", "I would say don't give your music away for free.  Lots of people will ask you to.  Don't.\n\nYou see, eventually you'll find someone willing to pay you for your music and if you aren't paid, then you aren't a professional.  Filmmakers and game designers will pay other people: engineers, gaffers, actors, environment artists, concept artists, etc.  But music is routinely offered spaces to composers as \"good for exposure and credit\" instead of as a paid gig.\n\nThe reason this drives me nuts most of all isn't that you're not getting paid.  It's that you're teaching a director or game designer that music has no value. There's little chance that, when they do their next game, they'll suddenly decide to pay you.  You taught them that music can be found for free, so they'll just look for someone else to do it for free.  You don't just hurt yourself when you give away what you've worked hard to create.  You hurt any other composer who is asked to give their music away for free.\n\nSo, please.  Don't.  Always negotiate something. Money on the backend, payment in a tiered system, something.  But not music for nothing.  You have value and so does your work.  Don't let cheapskates take that from you.", "I miss LucasArts games... I used to play full throttle a lot... \nWell... here it goes; \nAs a musician sometimes it's hard to get inspiration for personal projects, but... How bad is writer's block when you are being asked to compose a certain piece for a certain scene?", "Oh my god.  It's the worst.  However, when you're working as a professional composer, there are times where you admittedly have to say to yourself \"This isn't going to be the greatest cue you ever write.  It's not going to be the cue you're remembered for.  You just have to write something and get it done.\"  And so you end up writing some notes and eventually you have a cue and you move on.  It can be really hard, though, for sure.", "Yeah I get you, I guess in that case is easier since someone maybe more pleased with that, but deep inside you know that, and you repeat that to yourself, effin deadlines haha. Thank you! keep at it man! ", "I just wanted to say I really loved what you did for Republic Commando. That soundtrack remains on my phone to this day. Especially Dha Werda Verda. ", "That's awesome and I really appreciate hearing that.  Especially because, when I wrote that track, there was a dev on the team who told me one day \"If I have to hear that track one more time, I'm going to sharpen some pencils and gouge out my ears.\"  So, good to know that wasn't the opinion of everyone once the game went out the door.  :)", "Popsicles are frozen. Don't you find it difficult to type with frozen hands?", "I'm usually a very warm person.  My wife calls me a furnace.  I have no idea why, but the last few months it's like the pilot light went out in the furnace.  My fingers are stiff and freezing.  I have no idea why.  And yes, it's hard to play arpeggiated piano runs with frozen hands.", "Have you tried ingesting lava? It worked wonders for me. All joking aside I have a couple of serious questions. Is video game music composing a competitive business and how do you get your work? Do developers request certain composers or do you have to apply for projects?", "Like all freelancing, I'm finding that it's a constant process of reminding potential clients that you're around and you're available.  Game composing, like film and TV composing, is extremely competitive.  In part because film and TV composers often try and land game gigs.  Plus, you have a ton of collegiate programs now offering courses in game audio.  So, there are lots of people out there competing for gigs in an industry that is extremely secretive about what projects are actually being made.", "Thank your for your time and insightful answers sir. ", "You bet!", "How has the transition to freelance been?  What aspect of LucasArts do you miss the most now that you are freelancing? What aspect of freelancing do you appreciate the most that wasn't possible at LucasArts?", "Transitioning to freelancing has been okay so far.  Thanks for asking. :)  I was lucky in that, as the music supervisor for a major game publisher for so many years, I walked out of LucasArts with a great rolodex.  Plus, because everyone from LucasArts was let go, it means that everyone I know what forcibly dispersed throughout the game industry.  I know a lot of people at a lot of different companies now.\n\nWhat do I miss the most, though?  That's easy.  The people.  LucasArts had its issues, for sure.  Every company does.  But the people there were incredibly bright, talented, gifted, funny, handsome, etc etc. When LucasArts shut down, I actually wrote [a eulogy for the company that some people may have seen](http://imgur.com/a/0fIIt).\n\nFreelancing means that I now work remotely from my home studio.  I talk to my cats more than I talk to other devs, and I don't have the same ability to just walk the team floor, get inspired by concept art, participate in collaborative discussions, etc.  That's what I miss.\n\nHowever, I will say that the variety of projects I've been able to do since leaving LucasArts is wildly more varied than \"the next Star Wars game\".  I've done a 1960s jazz score.  I've written music for two animated shorts ([one of which you can find here](http://youtu.be/AmizOncbjt4)). I wrote some fun stuff for Juicy Beast's Toto Temple game ([you can hear it and download it here](https://soundcloud.com/dunderpate-music/sets/music-from-juicy-beasts-toto)).  So, that diversity of projects has been really fun.", "Love you work!\n\nWhat does it take nowadays to get into the industry as a composer? Any chances for the new guys?", "TOTALLY a chance for the new guys.  Maybe a better chance now that ever in the history of the game industry.  You have to keep in mind that, until the iPhone App store hit, there was effectively no indie game scene to speak of.  Nowadays, AAA studios are struggling while indies are flourishing. So, you can find lots of projects around where people are looking for music.\n\nHowever, I will say this, there are a bazillion composers out there looking to break into the industry, too.  So, the competition is really fierce.  But it's definitely doable.", "Thanks for the encouraging words!\n\nAlso, if it's not a secret, how is the business going with the freelance thing? Do people tend to buy a lot from you?", "I've been very busy!  To be completely honest, this is the first day off I've had in 3 months.  It's been crazy.  So, things are good so far.  Freelancing is feast or famine, though. We'll see how things continue.  Right now, though, I could use a small famine so that I can rest and recuperate some.  My tank in pretty empty after 3 months of crunch on various overlapping projects.", "Well, thanks for the answers and I wish you all the best! You've done some amazing work in the past and I'm sure you will so in the future! I will be keeping an eye on your great work now! Thank you.\n\nAnd I hope you will get some of that much-deserved rest.", "Favorite part of your job?\n\nAnd apart from yourself or your games. What/who are composers/games that really grab your attention these days?", "My favorite part of my job is the interactive music system design.  I'm completely in love with the interactive nature of game design and it's why I focus most of my efforts on writing music for games.  Film music is static and everyone who ever watches a movie will always have the exact same listening experience.  Games, though, are dynamic and you can create different experiences based on player choice and interaction.  It fascinates me and I love that side of things.\n\nI know it's maybe controversial, and I know at least one former coworker who told me that I was \"functionally retarded\" because of this view point, but I loved \"Heavy Rain\". It's one of my favorite games ever, and definitely in the top three of the last console cycle.  Its score by Norman Corbeil was phenomenal.  I was so sad to hear that he recently passed away.", "why did lucas hate star wars galaxies so much? \n\nplayed from launch till the kill by george to protect sw;torlet...  hows that workin out... not that im bitter and now hold lucas in the same place in my heart as i do ea who killed motor city online.  not bitter at all and i dance around the fire sacrificing nuna in the name of singing georges balls.  not a bit", "Yeah, no.  It's good that you're not bitter.  O_o\n\nBut, in reality, did Lucas hate SWG?  Nah.  They liked it.  And conversations about when to sunset it and why weren't ever anything I was privvy to.  What I do know is that the game industry is a tough industry to project trends with.  There was a time back in 2004/5 where the entire industry was saying \"Enormous MMOs are the wave of the future!! Stop smaller game development! Staff up tremendously! Make things HUUUGE!\"  And then, of course, about a year later the iPhone App store hit and all of those predictions about MMOs as the second coming of games turned out to be completely wrong.  So, existing MMOs and new MMOs were all caught in the middle of those massive shifting industry forces.\n\nI know that's not the answer you're looking for.

Good or bad.", "Oh, man.  I WISH.  Seriously.  I think most of the music I wrote at LucasArts actually went into games that got cancelled or never saw the light of day.  One of the things that always drove me nuts was that the public perception of LucasArts was one of \"meh.  They just make Star Wars games now.\"  But, actually, while we only ever seemed to release Star Wars games, we were constantly making other games.\n\nThey just were only ever in preproduction or concept phases.  They're definitely things that my NDA covers and I can't talk about, but there was a time where there were 3 teams at LucasArts: the Star Wars team, the Indy team, and then Team3 - the team tasked with coming up with original IP and they/we did.  That team cut their teeth by first doing the Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition, and then moved onto Lucidity.  You can hear a track I did for [the score to Lucidity here](http://youtu.be/DeYPyLwhTBU).\n\nBut there were tons of ideas, concepts, prototypes, etc. being developed by Team3 and others.  Unfortunately, the upper management at LucasArts and Lucasfilm put the kibosh on all of them.", "Behorsened Warriors: Noble or Super-Noble?", "UbÃ«r-Noble", "Do you believe in god?", "No, actually.

In the end, I find myself to be agnostic.", "How would you rate your skills as a ninja?", "Low.  On a scale of 1 to 100, I'm definitely in the single digits.  6? This is due, largely, to my extremely low tolerance for a guilty conscience.  I can't lie about things without it eating me up inside.  I can't sneak something past someone because then, every time I see them, I think about how how I snuck something past them.\n\nFor instance: once my wife and I went out to buy a broom. We wanted a broom with a dustpan, but didn't like any of the ones that had dustpans.  So, I took the dustpan we liked, attached it onto the broom we liked, and then we went and checked out from the store.  The clerk paused while ringing us up and said \"Is this the dustpan that comes with this broom?\"  \"I dunno,\" I lied. \"That's ... that's just how it was.\"  So, now I have an ill-gotten dustpan.  I think of it every time I sweep.\n\nAnd now I've just confessed it on Reddit.  So, clearly - single digit ninja.", "First off, I loved LucasArts from when i was a child.

Do I think fans will be fair to them?  No.  Case in point: people were complaining last week when someone in the \"press\" realized that there wouldn't be the 20th Century Fox fanfare at the top of the new films.  Which, you know, makes total sense since 20th Century Fox has nothing to do with them.  Didn't stop some fans from getting all riled up.\n\nSo, I'm sure there will be no end to the amount of sniping and grousing (to quote Queen), especially in the echo chamber of The Internet.\n\nHowever, that said, you have these things being made by people who are at the top of their field.  Who better to make a new Battlefront other than LucasArts than DICE?  Who better to make a new Star Wars film than the guy who's been called this generation's Spielberg?  And they don't make these things in a vacuum.  They have heavy-hitters and heavy influencers at Lucasfilm who will be involved still.  Some of whom, like Howard Roffman, have been there for the entirety of Star Wars' life since 1976.\n\nSo, yes.  I think they're all entirely capable of doing a great job.  Will the online fan community regard them as such, or will they wither against the dichotomy of expectations vs. actualized realizations?  Still TBD.", "Also, you have to keep in mind that there are some Star Wars fans for whom their Star Wars is that of the comics, the novels, and the rest of the Extended Universe that has grown up around the films.  With new films effectively establishing new canon, may of their favorite storylines and heroes might be wiped away.  That simple act will probably sour a fair number of fans to the new movies.\n\nLet's say they put the movies in the Heir to the Empire timeline, but Thrawn isn't in the mix anywhere.  Let's say that the new trilogy obliterates the possibility of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion.

My pawn shop is what you can call \"in the hood\" but it's not at that level that it is in Detroit.\n\nA thing to remember is that all the televised stuff you see on Pawn Stars is all the scripted stuff. They don't show you their actual business operations 24/7. They show you the people who have sent in their application.

Being in Cali, the gun laws are ridiculous for us as a dealer. As far as the demographic who buys them, it's generally going to always be collectors.

It's the internet! Everyone's gonna share what they find. \n\nThe second reason is we don't have the staff or resources. Cashback is a huge issue when it comes to tech, security, customer service etc, especially when you deal with people's money. Right now, we want to be at arms length.

Sure its easy to start a \"deal\" site where you scrape or take other people's content, but its far harder to build a community millions strong and that is our leverage.

I'll give you a real life example. My family member owns a mom and pop appliance store which successfully competes with Lowes and Best Buy within walking distance by satisfying the post-purchase service requirement.

We do allow merchants to do customer service on our website (but not many take us up on that offer, or do it well).\n\nThat being said, it has not stopped some companies from complaining.

We are huge fans of building our site architecture ourselves using components which do not come with a mandatory license for everything production.

All of that runs on commodity hardware, and everything except databases and HAProxy runs inside (small) virtual nodes (most of which are cloned from the same template). We try to take a 'shared nothing' approach and rely of hundreds of small nodes of which significant percentage can fail without end users noticing.

Black Friday is a great time to get some of those one-off deals, but in the past something like TVs, for example is happening year round.

I have 3 questions:\n  \n1. How do you see your business model evolving as companies continue to divest from the affiliate channel? Working in the eCommerce space, I know that many businesses (ours included) are always looking for ways to pay less to affiliates partners. Can you share a rough breakdown of how much revenue comes from affiliates vs display advertising?\n  \n2. How do you feel about cashback sites? At the end of the day, most Slickdealers know that they can get cashback from places like ShopAtHome or TopCashback. Merely banning names of competitors seems like more of stop gap measure than a permanent fix.\n \n3. Are you guys looking for more any additional forum moderators?

Sorry to see that you had a bad experience through the channel. If handled correctly, it can be a huge traffic &amp; sales driver. My suggestion is to gather as much data as you can and look at what drives you incremental sales/traffic.\n\n2. We are neutral to them. There are a few sites that we don't ban such as FW since they allow SD on their site. We ban competitors that don't allow linking to us. ShopAtHome has always been shady with their toolbar.\n\n3. We usually disqualify (not always) people who ask to be a mod. :)", "Thanks for the response! \n\n1. Sorry if I miswrote- affiliates can definitely be a big source of traffic/sales. That said, most companies aren't keen on subsidizing purchases. For example, if my company is running an awesome deal that we know will get posted on SlickDeals organically, there's no incentive for us to have a high payout rate for affiliates. Arguably, there's no reason to pay a commission rate at all, right? \n\n2. The reciprocal linking policy makes sense- I thought it was all competitors. ShopAtHome is definitely collecting all sorts of data with their toolbar but they have an amazing [Cash Back Guarantee](http://www.shopathome.com/top-cash-back-guarantee.aspx) which has saved me a bunch of $.\n\n3.
