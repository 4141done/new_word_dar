I just have more money now, and people think I'm a lot more mature. I'M NOT, ITS A TRICK.\n\nHere's how I break these down... it's mostly have money, don't be a douche.\n\n&gt; *Doesn't feel the need to get drunk every week \n\nHas money, pursues moneyed hobbies.

I grew up lower middle class, most of my family is working class. I lived for $1000 a month in Kansas - yes it's cheaper there, but that's still $12k a year. It can be done.\n\n* Need to get drunk - cheaper than traveling the globe, but I'm not hoping to travel the globe. I'll settle for a board game with one drink, or no drinks. Or a movie on netflix, which is surely cheaper than getting drunk. \n\n* Paying bills before buying shit - you can be poor, *in debt* and still understand you need to pay the electric bill before you can get the newest iphone. \n\n* How to keep a budget - again, you can be poor, in debt, living paycheck to paycheck, which is when you need a budget the most\n\n* I have fun at free events all the time. ALL THE TIME. I'm pretty close to broke. Some of my friends have close to zero money, so we find free and cheap events all the time. \n\n* Eating things other than meat and potatoes isn't necessarily cost. I have never ever ever been to a fancy restaurant. When I say something other, I mean ANYTHING else. Frozen veggies are relatively cheap, and much cheaper than most meat.

I'm assuming it's because they've already put in their 16 hour days and have/want to make time for relationships; they don't necessarily have the same career pressures as the young'uns, and because of it, they tend to be more well-rounded, and overall, more interesting. In my experience with OkCupid, the younger ones tend to define themselves with their careers. \"I'm a _____\" or \"I'm studying  ___\" (most likely not unique to males, but that's really all I've been looking at, so...) It makes sense since they're fresh out of school and haven't had time to find themselves, but it's honestly just boring to me. The more interesting ones are those with experiences to share.
