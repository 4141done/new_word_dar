As a result, you need not pay as much for that harm.  \n\nPunishment is not only designed to change behavior but also designed to cause an equilibrium in society.  Eye for an eye mentality.  And this is important.  Why?  Because of moral outrage.  It is natural for society to scorn people who harm it.  If we do not punish those people then society loses respect for the rule of law.

But your thinking seems to reflect a problem that a number of people on reddit have.  They see what they assume (or are told) is an \"innocent\" person, and then get upset that they were put in jail. \"This is a travesty!' \"Fuck the judicial system!\"  I understand we don't want to jail innocent people, but in this case, it's just wrong to not do so.\n\nYou know what is worse than having two lives ruined? Even more lives getting ruined. Say, hundreds or thousands of lives being ruined.  That's literally the thinking behind the court sending this guy to jail. If the courts allow a person who made a fatal mistakes to go free, they have to do the same for EVERYONE else that does the same.  There's no \"I feel bad for this guy\" defense, and that's a good thing. Do you really want people to have no incentive to drive better except for their own feelings on the matter? Keep in mind one of the reasons we have the justice system is that people will repeatedly make the same mistakes, even if it hurts someone else, unless there are incentives for them to do otherwise.\n\nAnd about a lapse of concentration just being a lapse of concentration. It's not, actually. This was a lapse in concentration behind the wheel of a metal death machine.  As shown by this case, cars are dangerous.  But they are also useful, and we don't want to get rid of them.  So what do we do? We try to limit the danger by imposing big, nasty penalties on people that don't concentrate while using these dangerous, useful machines.  It's a preventive, limiting measure.  If we as a society want to use cars (which we do), we certainly want to limit how dangerous they are.  But we can't exactly send everyone that has a lapse in concentration to jail, can we? Jails and courts are crowded enough as it is, we can't send every person who runs a stop sign to jail.  So when do we do it?  How do we provide as fair a method as possible of punishing those that violate it? The answer is that we punish people when they actually end up hurting someone.  \n\nAnd about the legal consequences of the defense...Do you really want judges letting off people that they just feel sorry for? That the judge, or jury, is given power to say that they think this is an alright guy and so he shouldn't have to spend his life in jail?  And, by the way,  what happens in the civil case?  What happens to the family members of the victim? Would they be denied recovery too because the guy just made a mistake?  \n\nI understand that some of the sentiment may be that the penalty is just too harsh, but that didn't seem to be the gist of what you were saying.  Who knows, maybe the penalty of jail is too harsh.  But it's a matter of degree, not whether it's right or wrong in the first place.  \n\nSorry if this seems like a personal attack, but it's honestly not directed at you, it's just towards the general sentiment you expressed.\n", "TL;DR\nDon't run over people.", "TL;DR There are good reasons we don't let people run over people?", "The purpose of punishment is not only to punish the behavior or to fix people but to rectify a moral loss to society and to create equilibrium.  Part of justice is very philosophical in nature.  If you run a red light and dont hurt anyone, the damage to society is minimal.

She was still staying with the weight loss regimen, with the goal of reaching 150 pounds...a loss of almost 700 pounds (part of that weight being extra skin that had to be surgically removed as she lost well over half her body weight).

It takes a certain amount of calories to maintain a weight.  1200/day would have been *far* under that.\n\nBefore the diet, she was probably eating over 5,000 calories a day.\n\nBasically, what I'm saying is that she had a far greater calorie deficit due to the diet than the exercise.  As she lost weight, though, the exercise would definitely become more important.  For a majority of people, proper diet *and* exercise is necessary.  Otherwise, you have to go to extreme on one side to get similar results.\n\nNow the crazy part: a pound of weight is roughly 3,500 calories.  People lose weight by cutting the amount of calories they intake and increasing the calories they exhaust.  A healthy amount of weight to lose is generally 1-2 pounds a week, while 3 pounds a week is considered a bit more extreme.

However, when considering the multi-cultural fraternities I don't think that's a fair assumption. And the numbers backing the claim actually include them.\n2. That assumption is actually a case by case basis. My fraternity, while I was in school, actually gave a probation period, a suspension period and then kicked a member out. Essentially, you had three semesters to get it right. A lot of times my uni kicked guys out before we did. Other fraternities were a lot quicker and others could care less. \n3. Can't say there weren't a lot of poly-sci guys, but we also had a fair amount of accounting and finance, engineering and bio-med guys. My uni is a top-50 business and a top-10 med research. I don't know what our engineering program would have been considered. Either way, there's a fair mix. As far as cheating goes, my uni did a really good job of keeping tests out of student hands and changing up exams. Basically I never had a test bank, maybe other fraternities did, but it wasn't a luxury I experienced. The advantage I would say I received, as well as the other guys, was the benefit of insight into professors and almost always having someone who had taken the course before and could help you study. However, I'm sure that cheating does go on in many chapters.\n\nHonestly though, the idea that you can judge a guy's character by his belonging to a greek org is a little silly.

Mostly it's been pleasant, except I've still not seen a frat house that doesn't have an overly intimate relationship with the bottle, my dear friend's inclusive.

You could also say that men are expected to be at work consistently and work long hours, regardless of whatever outside obligations they may have.

I did the deed, even if it was small, so I accepted it. I mean, I was still pissed that it was for that, but I couldn't really argue it. HOWEVER, as I walked to the office, I looked at what was written on the slip and it said, \"this student continuously disrupted class.\" This was the first time something prompted a verbal \"what the f---\" from me. Suddenly I realized I could talk to the dean about everything I noticed about the class, so I calmed down and walked to the office, like a good student.\n\nI walked in, sat down, the dean looked at me with a peculiar look, like she was expecting someone else, then asked me why I was there. I told her exactly what happened. She said she believed me, especially because she doesn't know my face and that she knows the teacher.

Men get to have families and careers, and women often have to choose. Re-entering the work force often puts us behind in our career and our salary, and while it's great to be paid fairly when you are under 30 and single, I just can't bring myself to accept that as a complete win.

This is a topic I feel very strongly on, so some of that emotion may have leaked through, despite my efforts to be entirely civil.\n\n-----\n\nAs a natural consequence of biology, women are more often in custody of a child when that child is born than a man is, yes.  The rare exception of man-only custody tends to involve a widower, or a prison inmate mother.  This same fact of biology makes women immune to cuckoldry, which men as a sex report as a more fearful outcome than being raped.\n\nHowever, it is still the choice of that woman to have a child or not.  She could choose not to have sex, give the child up for abortion, or drop the child off at a safe surrender center.  Note that when the child begins in the mother's custody, the father has none of those options, and he has no choice on whether to be financial liable for his child, or not.  Child support payments routinely exceed the amount each state provides per child to foster parents, often by an order of magnitude.\n\nThere are also many fathers who, when their wives divorce them, or when they find out a woman they slept with are pregnant, desire custody of their children.  However, due to the nature of court court system, they are often advised by lawyers that they cannot gain custody of the child without expending more money than they have.\n\nIf women would rather not suffer the cost of child care, some of them will have children who's fathers would dearly love to have those children.  Those mothers could chose to let the fathers care for them.\n\nThis is before we get into assistance programs that poor women have available to them, which poor men do not, and how many of those programs are specifically designed around women, with no husband, who have children.\n\nThe fact is that 70% of the homeless are men.  I propose that if these men had access to those programs due to having custody of their children, fewer of them would be homeless.\n\n-----\n\nIf the woman is wed, and her husband continues to work and she stays home with the children, she gets to take a multi-year sabbatical from work, while her husband still works to support her.  He will often have to work even harder and even longer hours to make ends meet, which is why married men tend to earn more than single men.  It's not a privilege of earning more than their single male counterparts, it's a cost.\n\nAs a sex women *tend to* find house-husbands unattractive.  Further, divorce rates in households with house-husbands are much higher than in those with male breadwinners and female housewives.\n\nThus, the option to *choose* to stay home and raise children is not as readily available to men as it is to women, even inside of marriage.\n\n-----\n\nWomen having more options, and choosing to take an option does not make women discriminated against.  Rather, it is the reverse.\n\nChoices come with the responsibility for making those choices, and responsibilities have costs.  They also sometimes have benefits.\n\nLooking not at the fact that a choice was made, or the benefits of a choice, but only the costs of that choice paint a woefully incomplete picture.\n\n-----\n\nOn a personal note, I would love to have a family, and be **reliably** able to raise and care for my own children.  However, that option is not open to me.  Were my theoretical wife to have an emotional episode, or become abusive, it is more likely I'd be arrested than her.\n\nIf my wife decided to divorce me, I would have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars just for the *chance* to have any measure of custody of my children.  That is money that only the wealthy tend to have, after being kicked out of their own homes, and having to split assets before hiring lawyers.\n\nIf it turns out that I have been cuckolded, not only do I have little to no chance of seeing the child I thought was mine, I will still be mandated to pay for the upkeep of that child, whether I want to care for that child, or not.\n\nThe reason I will not wed or have sex is not a fear of commitment on my part, but a lack of the ability to hold my theoretical opposite to her side of the commitment.\n\nFurther, a single man is even less likely to granted adoption by a family giving up their infant child than is a single woman.\n\n-----\n\nPlease do not complain about the costs of the options and blessings your sex enjoys.", "Why not? Saying something has a cost doesn't mean I don't value it. I appreciate your thoughtful response, but am not really looking for a debate. ", "Because when you complain about the cost in persuing an option that men do not have equal access to, it makes you seem very ungrateful for something women have, that men don't.  You also seem to be comparing women to men unfavorably, because of the blessings you have.\n\nWomen have the option to get married young (when their marital market value is relatively high, and will maximize their chances of getting a good mate), and they are of good child-bearing age.  Then, if she decides she does want a career, she can go to school while her children are in school, earning her degree as they gain independence, before going on to a career that then has minimal interruption.\n\nThis would minimize career disruption, maximize profit, increase the likelihood of healthy children, and decrease the chance of trying for children when it's too late for any individual woman.  By the time a woman hits thirty, her fertility has already significantly dipped.  While women over 40 can, and sometimes do have children, their fertility is many times lower than what it was when she was younger.\n\nFurther, many women who get married and have children decide to abandon their careers, as they prefer being housewives and mothers.  This is an entirely valid choice.  However, if they knew that before spending thousands of dollars on college, possibly going into student debt, and taking up seats that would be used by men and women who *do* want careers, it would be better for all involved.\n\nThat women instead choose to interrupt a career to have children when their fertility has already declined says nothing about any form of sexism in society, and it does not make the cost one inherent or exclusive to women (as house husbands do exist).\n\nWomen have more access to options, and sometimes use them.

One night you go to bed and then thanks to some government bureaucrats, you wake up the next day in a different time zone. You’re not allowed to just do that to time. Who the hell do you think you are, you can just take an hour here and put it a few months over there? No, and every year it gets worse, it used to be that you’d have to manually set your clocks to the new hijacked time, but with computers, with the Internet, it’s like it’s all happening behind my back.\n\n​I’ll never forget the first time I saw the higher-ups rob an hour from me, right in front of my face. I was watching TV, it was like one-thirty in the morning, there was nothing on but, I don’t know, I couldn’t get to sleep, so I was watching reruns of all of those really bad Comedy Central shows. I’m looking at the time, thinking to myself, man, only one more minute until Mind of Mencia is over. I really hope the next show isn’t so ridiculously unfunny.\n\n​And that’s when it happened. It went from 1:59, to 3:00, just like that. I took out my phone. Three in the morning. Are you kidding me? “Where is my hour?” I started screaming out loud to nobody in particular, “Where is my time going?”\n\n​Because, that’s traumatic. At least if you’re going to change the official time, just keep it to yourself. Fine, the banks and post offices are going start opening a little earlier, and yeah, the restaurants and movie theaters will probably have no choice but to follow suit. But what about me? Don’t I have a say in the matter? If I don’t feel like changing my watch, I’m not going to.\n\n​I don’t like this idea that you fall asleep and you wake up and it’s like, you don’t even need to be a part of the equation. “Don’t worry Rob,” whoever’s in charge of this is whispering in my ear, “You don’t have to worry about Daylight Savings Time at all this year. Just go to sleep, and when you wake up, everything will be adjusted for you. What’s that? You feel a little tired? You’re a little late for work? Well that’s not our problem. Just because you can’t get to work on time doesn’t mean that it’s the clock’s fault.”\n\n​But it is the clock’s fault. I remember one year, maybe it was the year after the cable box incident, I went to bed thinking, OK, I’ve got to make sure to consider Daylight Savings Time when I’m setting my alarm. I thought, I’ll just set the time for an hour earlier. And then it changed by itself, and my alarm time was the wrong time, even though it should’ve been the right time. And I was trying to tell my boss, I was like, no, just listen, please, I know this is two weeks in a row, but this is seriously an excuse here, I’m not kidding, just please listen to this one sentence, this one really long detailed sentence, because it’s not my fault.\n\n​I’m scared as to where this is all headed. It’s like, what’s to say I’m not going to go to sleep one night only to wake up and it’ll be months from now? Like, what the hell? Why is so cold out? How come it’s snowing? And I’ll look on the Internet and it’ll just say, “Relax Rob, everything’s fine, do to Global Warming Adjustment Time, we’re going to go ahead and say that today is February 9th. And yes, unfortunately that means that, since we skipped most of last year, you technically never filed your taxes. And so we had to audit you. And do you care to explain yourself here Rob, why haven’t you been paying taxes for the past several months? Can you explain these numbers?”\n\n​And what am I going to say? I’ll be shivering, it’s February now and I’m still wearing my summer pajamas, and when did the Internet get so smart? Why is it asking me about my taxes? Isn’t there an option to turn the clock back a little? But not the actual clock, I’m talking like the technological clock, like Windows 95, I remember you’d wake up after DST and there’d be a little window, “Do you want to change the clock?” or something like that, and that would be great, OK, fine, at least it’s giving me the option.

More so than any other year in the past. For the majority of the summer months, my alarm clock(s) went off roughly one hour before sunrise. I would be in the shower, shaved, dressed, and caffeined and nicotined before daybreak. I would be bringing my bicycle down a flight of stairs to the street below, usually just as the sun was peeking her glorious rays over the houses to the East. If I maintained this schedule, and perfect time frame, down to the minute - I would be at work approximately nine to 11 minutes early for work. This granted me enough time to walk in, grab the key to the server room, get a cup of coffee, and to be hassled at least once (about something trivial) on my journey through the cubicle forest (I'm a proponent of cubicles resembling more of miner's tunnels filled with slave workers than a forest).\n\nMother fucking DST comes along. Naturally I am clueless, thank fucking God my cell phones are smarter than me. You fucking know some places (in the U.S. mind you) just say fuck you DST, you don't exist?) Christ.

I signed up for Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going to Italy.\"\n\nBut there's been a change in the flight plan. They've landed in Holland and there you must stay.\n\nThe important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It's just a different place.\n\nSo you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would never have met.\n\nIt's just a different place. It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy. But after you've been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around.... and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills....and Holland has tulips.

If anything I'm pro \"this is hopefully the most difficult decision you will ever make in your life and you should lose sleep and cry and grapple with this choice\". We started making light of abortion, like its the equivalent of going in to get pimple cream from a dermatologist with the intent of making abortion more palatable. You should understand there's a good chance you're causing pain to another living creature and that you ARE snuffing out a life.\n\nThat said, I would NEVER EVER look down on a woman who made an informed decision and opted to terminate or carry on with a pregnancy. \n\nI just think that now that abortion is largely settled, we should start moving a bit towards the center when we talk about it. \n\nI think its pretty clear that I personally tend to lean towards figuring out a way to save the pregnancy. But, it's easy to sympathize with a baby that will likely have birth defects or was the victim of a rape, or is on drugs and doesn't want to bring a child in to the world that could potentially wreck her chances of getting sober or raising a kid around drug abuse. \n\nI dunno, it's just, really fucking tough stuff to weigh, ya know?", "Its one of the main reasons I decided to not have any more children.

Having any more kids will further push us into an even more difficult life and we cant do that to the little boys we already have. Its a trip what life throws at you sometimes.

That's why I phrased it as, \"If I believed\", because if I had really felt that my children would be born with the things they said they would be born with, I would have aborted. After an early ultrasound, I was told that my third child would be born with his intestines outside his body, requiring surgery and pain and all kinds of things that are just not good. I reviewed those scans, I contacted an expert across the country to view them, I requested future scans, I was relentless. The overwhelming concensus was that the initial round of test was wrong, and he would be fine. He has a condition that they never tested for, which does make his life hell from time to time, but his stomach and intestines were right where they were supposed to be. However, if the agreement had been that he was about to be born into pain and have no real chance of true normal, yes, I would have had the abortion. \n\nI'm one of those people that believes that since the woman has to carry the child, the woman has about 99% of the control over whether or not to go through with it.

No matter what, it is going to be difficult. My oldest daughter had trisomy 18. I wasn't high risk so no one tested me. My  daughter was small, but the doctor wasn't concerned and just scheduled me for a level two ultrasound at 26 weeks. That is where everything changed. I was classified high risk, given shots to mature her lungs, and had me scheduled for a ton of tests. At 29 weeks she was in distress, so they delivered her. She was 1 pound 12 ounces and 12.5 inches long. She could not breathe on her own and she had birth defects on her hands and feet. She was perfect to us, but this let us know something more was going on.\n\nI was always afraid I couldn't handle a child with such issues, nor did my husband, but that all changed. All that we wanted was for her to be okay. No doctor would let us know what they thought it was, only that it was probably a genetic disorder. At day three we found out about the heart defects. It was at that point we knew it was possible to lose her. She needed to grow in order to have surgery, but the defects would make it nearly impossible to grow. My husband and I did research and figured out what it probably was.\n\nOn day six, she wasn't doing well. After dinner, we found out it was the worse and she was not going to make it through the night. My husband and I had to make a choice to let her die in her incubator, which could be several hours, or to take her off life support and hold her. We couldn't let her die alone. My husband told me he couldn't be the one to hold her. I didn't know if I could, but I knew I had to. We each held her. Then I held her and her daddy and I sang her to sleep for the last time. She died in my arms. \n\nIt was the hardest thing I have ever been through in my life. I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning, but I had people who loved me, and I got help. I miss her every single day, and it will always hurt, but I am glad I met her. She changed me for the better. I don't think I would appreciate life the way I do if I hadn't met her and I am a happier person in general (even though some things make me incredibly sad).\n\nI have an 11 month old and she is the center of my world. I did have an amnio with her. My husband and I needed to know after being blind-sided, but we new we wanted her no matter what. That was a personal choice. I would not judge anyone for choosing different. She is happy and healthy. I am pregnant with my third and will be having genetic testing (even though it is unlikely something would be wrong). Luckily, I can get a Maternal21 test (it's a blood test and it is 99% accurate. My insurance didn't cover it last time). It is unlikely to have another issue (it was random), but it is always on my mind. \n\nNo matter what, it's your choice. It's about what you can handle. I hope everything turns out okay.

The differences in quantifiable things like GPA and SAT scores are negligible between applicants, and of course are themselves flawed measures of capacity to contribute to the institution in question.

I went to two universities, and have worked for three large corporations and can tell you that diversity is extremely important, if not critical to an organization's/corporation's success.  \n\nI am a white man, and if I were ever asked to hire for my team I would always seek out people who are different than my current team first and foremost.  I have been on the all white male teams before, and have been on a team of 14 white woman and me.  Those teams were cancerous, and they spawned very few new ideas.  They became more of a club, people hanging out forming cliques, lots of infighting.\n\nOn my first team with 14 women, 2 men were hired to replace 2 of the women, one was black one was white.  The mood of the team changed almost overnight.  I've seen this happen the opposite way where adding one Asian female to a team of white men changed the entire dynamic of a team.  Adding Indian &amp; Chinese students to my teams at school brought perspectives I had never even considered, and got our team thinking  and discussing new ideas.\n\nAn all white university will spawn a bunch of boring in the box thinkers.  Without being exposed to new cultures and different views students will never expand their frame of reference.  You're white you have no idea what it's like to be Black, or Asian, or Indian, or Latino, and vice versa.  The entire point of college is not for you to get good grades and graduate, its for you to see the world differently, to understand different points of view, to have new experiences with people and ideas which will in turn enlighten you, and turn you into a free thinker.

A black girl from the projects has a 90 average and a 2000 SAT score. A white boy from the suburbs has a 91 average and a 2100 SAT score. The boy has a better academic record, but you can say easily the girl worked a lot harder to get her scores the way they are. So by that, yes she would be getting in with lower stats, but she put in more effort. \nAlso, keep in mind many people of color are poor due to discrimination on many levels. It's VERY hard to break the cycle of poverty. Also, many people of color are first in their families to go to college, but may not afford to go due to not having let's say 2000 dollars. It's a more reasonable amount to a middle class family although it's not chump change obviously. But trust me, to a poor family, that's A LOT. So a college may find it's worth it to just pay that for the student through scholarships and financial aid. \n\nLastly, I very much prefer focusing on socioeconomic rather than race.

At this stage in their growth, it's all they have. They have yet to attain the sales volume to stand on their own two feet due to the merits of a car people want and can afford. I'm not saying that's all their fault (there are a few things they could learn from the auto industry at large, to be sure) but it's pertinent. The two Tesla models, the S and Roadster, are very expensive and limited in production and sales. They're third or fifth cars for wealthy families, not the practical daily driver for Mike and Susan down the street. (Mostly due to their high price point) Because all their sales right now essentially amount to rich people looking for a fashion statement, all they have to keep driving sales is image, and it doesn't take a lot to tarnish that image. And it's not like this has been the only controversy regarding the Model S in its year or so of production. \n\nYes, thousands of cars catch fire every year. But from companies that produce and sell millions of regular cars every year, it's easy to not think about. For a smaller company that bills itself so high on being the perfect futuristic alternative, they rely a lot on that image. In the early days of the car, people saw every problem the car had and extolled the value of the horse. The reason we drive cars now is not because we needed to then, or would need to now, but because the companies making cars then were led by men with a penchant for the industry they were inventing, and the ability to run a business in a way that actually could become profitable.\n\nThis I think is Tesla's main failing: they reject the auto industry entirely, adopting the Apple Store model, instead of taking what lessons can be learned. For example, the dealer system. The auto industry doesn't do this to make you have a bad day when you buy a car, they do it because it gives them access to lots of capital up front to pay down the cost of developing and beginning production of a new car. In the first week of selling a new car, an automaker can rack up thousands of sales to dealers who can afford to sell the cars over a few months. Compare to the first week of selling a new car only through your website and some stores around the country. You get marginal sales at best. No doubt, with great enough economies of scale, the Model S could become profitable on its own, but Tesla's business model doesn't allow for high enough sales to make it so. You may or may not be surprised to learn that Tesla only \"paid off its loans\" because of a combination of tax credits and the sale of carbon credits. (They get lots of carbon credits for selling cars that don't have tailpipe emissions, and then sell these credits to other automakers, so they can pass various emissions criteria as a company)\n\nThe hivemind's Tesla circlejerk is going to crucify me for this, but Tesla Motors does suffer from a fairly large failing, in the stubbornness of its executives in their decision to reject what keeps the auto industry profitable. Even luxury manufacturers in the same segment are making tons more money and sales, simply because they understand the nature of what they're selling, and how to sell it. I think, if Tesla can learn a little from BMW or Mercedes-Benz, they might actually make it. But right now, because they refuse to accept that they might not be running a car business as efficiently as possible, I don't hold out a lot of hope. And this whole car fire thing isn't helping, because all they have right now is their image.", "I'm not sure about this, but I think Elon Musk decided against the dealership system deliberately. \n\nI know for a fact that Tesla has yet to make an affordable car because they don't want to. The roadster was model 1 in terms of development for Tesla. With the information they learned in Roadster production they managed to make a luxury performance electric car both affordable and practical. \n\nI'm interested to see what Tesla will be rolling out in the next decade because I expect their cars will be affordable for most middle class Americans while being safer and more reliable (if not only because of how simple electric motors are)", "They've been billing up a $30,000 compact sedan since they announced the Model S.

Cars are very low-volume, especially expensive cars. The only way to effectively recoup the cost of developing a car in time to keep the shareholders happy (and keep money in the company) is to sell them through a dealership model, or to sell them at ridiculously high cost. Tesla has done neither, and as such, has yet to profitably sell a car.

That's why everyone is astonished when they failed to deliver", "I think scale is the important factor here. Let's use California as an example for sales, which is a bid odd to begin with because a huge percentage of Teslas are sold there anyway.  \n\nAlmost 7k Model S vehicles have been sold in California. This is basically the only vehicle Tesla sells with the exception of a handful of Roadsters. There are an estimated 1.7 million vehicles sold in California in 2013 total. That means, in California, Tesla sells less than .5% of all cars sold.\n\nIf you scaled the number of failures to a popular selling car, like the Prius (sold 54k in 2013), there would be 21 obscure failures.  If this happened in California, you bet your ass there would be a recall. Remember unintended acceleration? Tesla is not simply immune to these types of investigation because they make cars that are \"different\". \n\nThe NHTSA is a becoming more and more stringent, we all know this.  Ever since the advent of 3 point safety belts, airbags, and such, they are simply adding to the \"required list of components\" in all vehicles sold in the US.  In addition, they need to investigate when a distinguished pattern presents itself in new vehicles.\n\nFerrari got the same exact flak, mentioned here somewhere, for the glue in the rear wheel arches of the 458 heating up. Also, a perfect example of scale. They issued the recall accordingly and took care of it because they don't sell very many cars total.  In those cases of exotics, the engines in question are extremely high performance, large displacement units.  Of course a 4.5L V8 that revs to 9k rpm is going to give off a significant level of heat. It's basically a dry-sump direct injection racing engine.\n\nI think the general belief here is that most people are convinced that Elon has created a car that is vastly superior to anything ever built previously.  That being said, I agree many components provide a unique approach in engineering and admirability.  However, the basics of engineering is R&amp;D and Tesla has basically no \"history\" with the Model S.  It hasn't been driven to the extent that a Land Cruiser has over the course of 40+ years.  Trusting the \"new kid on the block\" blindly without understanding the genetic make-up of automotive engineering leaves most people in a bit of spot of blissful ignorance.  \n\nThe thing that scares me personally is the fact that these failures are happening on BRAND NEW cars. These are catastrophic failures on brand new vehicles.  This is just a guess, but, I would attribute the overwhelming percentage of vehicle fires to older vehicles that have mechanical and electrical wear on them. Mechanical failures account for 44% of vehicle fires.  Major mechanical failures most often happen well above 100k miles.  Many new sedans don't have to have anything other than oil and tires serviced for the first 100k miles.  Nissan, Chevy, Mitsubishi, Ford, and all the other electric car manufacturers haven't dealt with this for their electric cars.  If there was a fundamental issue with electric vehicle technology, it might show up in all of them. But, it doesn't.  All these companies share the experience of building road cars for 50+ years.  Their proven experience in development, reliability, and manufacturing show how they know how to do it differently.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMusk's arrogance regarding the use of electricity and independent development methods might be his Achilles' heel here.  \n\nPeople trust in Tesla like they do in Evolution. They listen to scientists who explain it to them in layman's terms and feel smarter. When in actuality, you're taking someone's word for it no differently than believing in creationism.

There is actually a really good reason to freak out if you are an investor.\n\nTesla's strategy is enormously risky for the following reasons:\n1. There is no diversification in technology\n2. The battery warranty is 8 years on cars that have never been driven for that long\n3. First mass manufacture to market ensures you are open to all risks that haven't been considered\n\nEssentially the share price is still very high compared to what a conservative valuation of the company would indicate and the reason is that people are betting that Tesla can deliver on its promise (profit over warranty costs), build brand value and grow market share. The share price now is a reflection of where some people think the company is going to be in 10 years time. This is one of those cases where the company is likely to either be really successful of bankrupt by the time its technology is truly tested.\n\nCars catching fire is an indicator that the warranty cost could end up being high and 8 years is a very long time to pay for every car that catches fire. To put that in context, a lot of manufactures only have a 3 year warranty on combustion engines with mature technology. 3 years is not all that the cars are good operators for but it is used to help trigger new car sales at the 3 year mark. Tesla is a premium brand and premium segment customers are even more likely to change at the 3 year mark but defiantly by 5 years, the rest is a waste for the first owner, the person making the purchase.\n\nSo why would Tesla give such a warranty, batteries lose maximum charge over their life span so unless every other electrical devise is operating with a really constricted forced obsolescence model and Tesla isn't (possible), or Tesla is hoping they can improve their technology drastically over the next 3 years so their forecasted warranty costs will go down. But that still doesn't explain why they would place such a bet unless the 8 year warranty boast is purely to inspire investor confidence.\n\nTesla needs funding, they need people to believe in them to invest in them. They are on a PR offensive to raise investor confidence and at the heart of that PR is their 8 year warranty. That is why one car catching fire is the difference between $150 and $125 per share because it directly relates the the bet the company has made. Wheres my money?

There was a hustle and bustle and many people were kicked out of the country for illegally working, because it is pretty damn rampant. Mostly teachers, since it is very very common for unqualified people to go to China to teach English illegally (with fake papers). This affected all cities, not just Beijing (I was in Shenzhen).", "I didn't say it was a requirement.  I said it happened.  Because it did.

A lot of the big recruitment programs that target young Westerners to go to China to teach pay shit and if they're promising living quarters, it can potentially be trashy.

The company in China, on paper, was a completely different entity and I didn't work for that entity. Based on that technicality, I worked in China for 16 months on a tourist visa. As you may know, there are several types of visas available, my initial visa was a yearlong multi-entry visa with 90 days per stay. I went to re-apply for a visa in Hong Kong when that expired. Generally the Chinese government will issue much shorter visas when you're applying in Hong Kong (or pretty much anywhere outside of your home country). My new visa was for 6 months, multi-entry, but only allowed 30 days per stay. Either way, I had to border hop to Hong Kong all the time to bypass the day-limits per stay. I am very familiar with the visa process and border hopping to keep them valid, sans bribery.\n\nI have many friends that still live in China who are doing exactly what you did, to a T.

In 2012, when there was all the bogus about the world ending, he kept talking about how he had a visa to go to Tibet so he could survive the floods in the Himalayas (Never seen someone so disappointed that the world didn't end).
