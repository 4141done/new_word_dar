I read this column last week, as I'm in the newspaper business and we typeset pages like this far in advance. Our newsroom flagged it as a hoax at first. Sometimes we find columns where the the letter and subject matter are just whacked enough to make us sceptical. We ran this column because even if the letter is bullshit, Amy's response is pretty great. Several years ago, I pulled a Dear Abby from print because the letter was a very obvious copy of a Simpson's episode (Life on the Fast Lane - 1990). It's the one where thoughtless Homer buys Marge bowling lessons for her birthday and she ends up crushing on the instructor. Obviously neither Abby nor her editor were Simpsons fans.

Hmm.", "I dunno... i would agree with you, but the line \"i have a busy schedule\" is just way too perfect.  Its that over the top self righteousness that makes me think troll.  There are people who think that a son could chose to be gay as a form of revenge, absolutely.  But to go into a column and actually pretty much go into why you are a bad parent and quickly and smugly write it off like that... it seems almost too perfect to be legit.  \n\nThat, and the \"he may listen to you\" part.   While again cognitive dissonance can be strong, you would think most people who read a column enough to want to write into it have a general feel for the views and opinions of the person they are writing, and someone with this particular line of thought would, most likely, not take advise from someone with such complete opposite beliefs.  \n\nLastly, the part about her being afraid of being made fun of.  I would just tend to think that the people who would write in to have someone \"fix\" their gay kid would not use that language.  I would think the fears would be more along the lines of her or her child being excommunicated, or shunned by the community.  Not 'made fun of'.  That's too light hearted for this.\n\nAgain, i know people like this writer do exist, not denying that.  But the letter itself just feels too much like it was written by someone trying to impersonate the religious anti-gay zealot. In the end, i go with occams razor.  What is more likely, that a religious mother very quickly dismisses that she has no role in her sons life, and asks an advise columnist that she must not read very much to fix her gay son with a few paragraphs of text so that she personally wont be laughed at, or that some teens decided to make fun of a stereotypical right wing mom figure and troll an advise column.

The crime of larceny, which dates back to old England, is what the shoplifter would be guilty of in common law jurisdictions (i.e. jurisdictions that retained the old laws of England). For our purposes, we'll assume this jurisdiction still recognizes the crime of larceny. Most crimes, including larceny, require two general elements. One is an illegal act, the other is a criminal state of mind.\n\nFor larceny, the *actus reus* (fancy latin term used to describe the illegal act), is the taking and carrying away tangible personal property of value from another's superior posessory interest by trespass (i.e. the wrongful taking of any physical property which another has a greater right to possession in than the taker). \"Taking any carrying away\" might seem hard to determine; however, any asportation is enough (this means even the slightest movement).\n\nConcurrently, the taker must have the following *mens rea* (term for culpable state of mind): specific intent to *permanently* deprive another of tangible personal property of value. \n\nWhile concurrence between the state of mind and criminal act are necessary, larceny is considered a continuing offense, and thus, even if a person takes something without the present intention of permanently depriving another of the thing, having that intention at any point subsequent to the taking will meet the coincidence-in-time requirement. This is just what we call a \"legal fiction\".\n\nAnyway, to answer your question specifically, because you \"*intend* to pay\" for the chocolate bar, you will not be guilty of larceny unless your intentions change. But, as you might imagine, proving what is going on in a person's head is incredibly difficult, and often impossible. So, a good rule of thumb would be: wait to do anything demonstrating dominion over the thing (e.g. eating the food you intend to buy) until you have paid for it.\n\nP.S. - I don't have time to go through and proofread this, more than likely, atrocious mess of a post. So, I hope it isn't too poorly written.

If you're in a tornado that tears down walls and you aren't living in a trailer, then you should be underground.  Everyone seems to know the best way to handle living in a tornado zone even though they've never even been in one.  I'm not trying to be snippy, but it just gets old hearing these sort of remarks.  I've been in 3, F5 tornadoes and lots of much smaller ones, including the one that caused the revision to the EF scale in 1999 and more recently, the largest one ever recorded (2.6 miles wide).  Lots of my family and friends lost their homes this past May.  You just can't understand unless you've personally experienced it.  People say things like \"just move\" or \"build better buildings.\"  Those sort of statements just prove that they don't understand all of the intricacies involved with this specific weather phenomenon. I've seen a drinking straw through a telephone pole--literally no material is safe in a tornado.  As for moving, why don't Californians move every time there's an earthquake that causes damage?  Because home is home, and the big damaging ones don't happen all the time.  Large tornadoes are about the same frequency as major quakes, just for a couple of cities like my home there have been years that were exceptions.  I went 14 years without seeing a major damaging tornado.  I've also now lived in California for almost a decade and feel quakes frequently, have had things broken, but have yet to be in a major one here.  People back home ask about the quakes the same way people here ask about the tornadoes back home.  The sentiments being so similar make it so I don't understand how people don't get it.  You can move, but you'll trade one thing for another.  I've almost had my home burned down by the forest fires here, I watched a city decimated by a quake when I lived in NZ.  You just pick which ones you are willing to deal with, and if you live in an affected area, you take precautions.  You recognize you might lose possessions, but those can be replaced, and you brush yourself off and carry on.  Only 23 people died in Oklahoma in May because we understand tornadoes are unavoidable and precautions like underground shelters need to be in place.

The nails didn't get much into the wood, which is why it fell\n\nSource:  I am friend's with the person this actually happened to, and I'm surprised to see this pictures on here.", "&gt;1- The drywall fell because it was 5/8\" instead of 1/2\" (heavier, more expensive and a pain to work with, don't know why it was used here) and because there was no strapping above it\n\n This is demonstrably untrue. 5/8 is often used and the weight isn't an issue. In fact, it's more rugged/rigid than 1/2 and overall a better product. This looks like it was double layered. Most likely cause was that it wasn't screwed off properly in field spacing and/or screw depth. If it's in fact double layered like I believe it is, they likely tacked on the first layer rather than screwing it off which may be part of the problem. Might have been moisture or a roof leak going on up above. \n\nAlso, strapping is a code thing. Not everybody used it and it probably has zilch to do with why this ceiling failed. \n\nSource: Journeyman carpenter.", "When do you ever strap drywall, what is drywall strapping. You screw drywall to the studs, thats it?", "You strap the \"lids\" or ceilings only. Its ferring/strapping (or strips of wood) that you nail to the ceiling joist in the opposite direction to create a grid. Some states do it, others don't. Anyway, the drywall is then fastened to the strapping rather than the joists. \n\nWith walls, the drywall generally gets fastened directly to the studs. ", "til thanks\n\n", "Strapping is nailing strips of 1x3 to the ceiling joists, perpendicular to them; the sheetrock is then screwed to these straps instead of being screwed directly to the joists. This is mainly done to prevent the joints between the sheets from cracking in later years due to twisting of the joists and overall settling of the house. This is of course why it's almost never done on cheap-ass construction, because the builders are long gone by the time this becomes a problem.\n\nSecondary benefits of strapping are that it allows you to run new wire along the ceiling without drilling holes in the joists, and that it allows you to change the direction the sheets are run and possible minimize the amount of seam you have to mud.\n\nOne thing strapping would *not* do is prevent the ceiling from collapsing like this if the sheetrock weren't attached properly. No idea why the original commenter here claimed that.", "Don't know what State you're from but most areas in Wisconsin it is code to have 5/8 on the ceiling. 5/8 isn't just heavier, it has fibers in it which make it ALLOT stronger than 1/2\", 5/8 also has a fire rating far beyond what 1/2\" has, i.e. 2 layers of 1/2\" does not equal one layer of 5/8 as far as a fire rating.\n\nThis is caused by one of 2 things, shoddy workmanship or the roof leaked making the insulation wet and heavy causing the drywall to fail.", "I wouldn't openly admit being a contractor if those are the best observations you come up with.\n1 - thickness of drywall isn't going to matter. Poorly fastened drywall, maybe. Strapping? Who straps drywall?\n2 - split level houses are very common. Also, blown insulation can and is used in any cavity needing insulation, be it walls, floors, and attics. In fact, since blown-in insulation has a higher R-value per inch (either fiberglass or cellulose) than batting, it's preferred in small spaces. Plus it fills around electrical fixtures and plumbing, increasing insulating value.\n\nMy guess is that they blew too much cellulose (the type of insulation pictured) which weighed too much for the ceiling to support, or there's a roof leak and the cellulose absorbed water and got too heavy. But my money's on too much insulation.", "I'm not going to say I'm an expert but I have done enough drywall to know that if the insulation is over-packed, you're going to have a bad time. I think your assessment is the best on here. Even if the right fasteners are used with the right spacing, if too much weight is placed on the drywall it's just going to fall through the screws (assuming screws were used).

Strapping would be strips of ferring/wood nailed to the trusses/joist in the opposite direction creating a grid. The drywall would be nailed/screwed to that instead of directly to the joist.\n\nIf you already have blown in insulation, it's probably settled making it look like very little. Depending on where you live, some states can/will do an energy audit for you on request and can get you help for such things. Part of your utility/electric bill already pays for this.

For all you interested redditors, let me tell you what went down. The location is the English Garden in Munich, Germany.\n\n&gt;TL;DR: Bonerman is the honey badger's closest relative.\n\n&gt;So we had our Reddit meetup and it was drawing to a close. 3 people had already went on their separate ways when JohnyDream suddenly started laughing and pointed out this guy's boner. Sure people here in Germany don't mind public nudity and it's a normal thing to see on such a beautiful and warm day, but this guy had a full-blown hard-on. After 10 minutes, everybody in the vicinity had noticed and there was much merrymaking. People posed next to Bonerman, while taking pictures, attempting to strike his Pride with a tennis ball, and commited many other acts. One of these was covering him with an empty chips bag. Bonerman either slept through everything, is an attention whore, or just really didn't give a shit (props to him if it's the last one). I really doubt he was sleeping the whole time since one guy actually slipped and fell on Bonerman after attempting to step over him.\n\n&gt;So after maybe 15 minutes, Bonerman turns to the side and loses his \"hood\" and his wood. Disappointment all around... As if responding to the mood that had set in, he once again lifted all our spirits by showing himself off for the whole park to see, once again in his magnificent, throbbing glory. In response, a passerby took his [Maß](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Jugg_with_Beer_Loewenbraeu_one_liter.JPG/170px-Jugg_with_Beer_Loewenbraeu_one_liter.JPG), covered Bonerman up, and even grabbed his hand and placed it around the Maß handle. Bonerman didn't give a shit... All in all, the craziest thing was still the fact that he kept an erection in a bigass park with hundreds of people laughing at him for at least 30 minutes.\n\n&gt;EDIT2: Shoutout to /u/eichhornchen_liebe who posted [his picture](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i8oix/letting_that_european_flag_fly/) of the same thing shortly after JohnyDream.", "Sounds like a shitty thing to do to somebody just trying to enjoy the beautiful day.
