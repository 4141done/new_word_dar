You greet someone, you expect a greeting. Someone thanks you, you acknowledge their thanks. A lot of these, when you say them, lose their literal meaning because they're fulfilling the function of a pair: a greeting/greeting pair could be \"What's up?\"/\"How's it going?\", and neither are expected to be literally answered. They become agents of formality. \n\nNow some of these pairs, you can answer broadly: \"Thank you\" can be paired with a positive \"You're welcome\" or \"My pleasure\", or a dismissive \"No problem\" or \"Don't mention it\" and so on; but others are very narrow, such as \"How're you?\" and \"Fine/Good.\" You could answer \"A little lousy\" or \"Sad\" or \"I'm kind of high right now, actually\" and it would be understood, but odd on the ears. You might cause a verbal hiccup in your conversation. \n\n\"I love you\"/\"I love you too\" is like this. You can answer things other than \"I love you too\", but \"I love you too\" is prettymuch what we expect to hear. Furthermore, we're typically saying this as a function, (normally some kind of degreeting/degreeting: thing of how many times you say \"I love you\"/\"I love you too\" when you're about to leave the other person, or disconnecting from a phone conversation), so we're not thinking too deeply about the meaning. \n\n...tl;dr: most people *aren't* going to reply to \"I love you\" with something other than \"I love you too\" because that's what the language part of our brains tells us to reply with.

Llama wool is finer, warmer, and more valuable than sheep wool. It is also hypoallergenic and contains no lanolin.\n\n\n2. Llamas are grazers AND browsers, meaning they eat grass, leaves, bushes – anything green! You can own two llamas happily on a single half-acre of good Bermuda grass.\n\n\n3. Llamas eat only 1/3 the amount of grass or hay as compared to horses or donkeys of the same size. They can carry 1/3 of their weight in a pack, making them more efficient packing animals than any other.\n\n\n4. Llamas can adapt to most any climate. Their modified blood allows them to be breathe easily at very high altitude, the long fur keeps them warm in cold weather, and they can tolerate high heat if shaved.\n\n\n5. Llamas reduce herd loss. Their most common job in the US is as guardian animals for sheep, goats, and other herds. They chase away predators as large as mountain lions and significantly reduce herd deaths from predation.\n\n\n6. Llama manure, called “Llama Beans,” is one of the best fertilizers in the world. It does not “burn” plants, it is high in nitrogen and potassium, and its unique dry bean shape is not originally moist or messy to the touch while still readily absorbing and locking in moisture when watered.\n\n\n7. Llamas leave pastures better than they found them. They specifically eat out weeds and low bushes or branches before the better grasses, allowing for more and better grass to grow for other livestock.\n\n\n8. Llama herds are very clean and poop in a communal pile, usually at the same time. If you want the location of this pile to change, you need only clean up the pile and put some of the poop where you DO want it to be. The llamas instinctively go to that location from then on.\n\n\n9. Because of their unique poop habits, llamas are naturally house trained and can be taken anywhere including indoors for up to two hours before needing to relieve themselves. They will NOT poop anywhere but their herd piles unless under extreme duress.\n\n\n10. Llama spitting is a dominance behavior usually only between male llamas. Any well trained llama that was raised properly and not abused will know to never spit at a human, because humans are not other llamas to fight with.\n\n\n11. Llamas (and other camelids) are nearly silent. They hum when upset and only make louder noises as an alarm that they are under attack from a predator or while mating.\n\n\n12. Llamas are “induced ovulators” like rabbits. They can breed at any time of year and the females become fertile only after breeding. They have no period – if your female is bleeding, she needs a vet!\n\n\n13. Llama gestation is exactly 11 and 1/2 months and they can rebreed after two weeks, meaning llamas almost always have exactly one cria (baby) a year on nearly the same day every year.\n\n\n14. With the exception of in-tact adult males, llamas have no upper teeth and cannot bite. Males grow “fighting teeth” to defend with, but these are only canine teeth that are usually clipped and removed once grown in for safety.\n\n\n15. There is no such thing as a “wild” llama. Llamas were bred in captivity from their wild ancestor species, the vicuna. Alpacas were bred from the guanaco. Both vicuna and guanaco are descendants of an extinct North American camelid.\n\n\n16. Llamas have feet – not hooves. They are vastly more stable than horses or donkeys on rocky, uneven, or narrow trails, and their feet do not damage or tear up the grass or ground or floors like animals with hooves do.\n\n\n17. On average, llamas are smarter than dogs and can be trained to do almost anything given time. They are most commonly trained to guard livestock, carry packs, climb mountains, pull a cart, work with the elderly or ill, and taught all manners of tricks and games – including fetch.\n\n\nI can go on for days.

The wavelength of light they use is specially calibrated to be absorbed by the hemoglobin in your blood that is bound up (usually by oxygen, not always).  The device measures how much light it shoots out, and figures out how much got absorbed (because if it shot out 100 packets and only got 2 back, that's a 98% absorption rate).  That is your oxygen saturation level.\n\nOf note, like I said, it can only tell you *that* the hemoglobin is bound.

", "Yo, words are the barest tip of the iceberg of the cool shit about human language. \n\nIf you hear a word you've never heard before, you look it up or ask what it means or try and infer from context. But totally out of context you can hear a sentence no one has ever heard before, like:\n\nDoreen should have already pickled most of my ex-uncle's competition pigeons. \n\nAnd as bizarre as it gets, you know what it has to mean. Compositionality, motherfuckers. You know gobs about how words fit together that *no one ever taught you*, and the rules are complicated enough that we're still just figuring out consciously the extent of our unconscious knowledge about them. Like: \n\nA lawyer who baked something was late to the party. \n\nOK, got that sentence. Suppose I wanna know what he or she baked? But if I try to ask that question:\n\nWhat did a lawyer who bake was late to the party?\n\nIt's total garbage, it breaks the language. The normal question rule can't apply out of relative clauses, and this fact was only noticed a few decades ago. Syntax is full of shit like this, and a lot of it is still mysterious... ", "What did a lawyer who was late to the party bake?", "This is what I thought... feel like I'm missing something... perhaps the op can explain the problem a little more for us laypeople?", "If you haven't already, read Chomsky's *On Structures and Syntax*. In it, Chomsky argues that grammar is generative, i.e. that there are structures which (as you point out) haven't been taught, but which make sense to us, because of the patterns we've learned.\n\nHis classic example is \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\". It makes zero logical sense, and yet we can still understand the basic idea.\n\nComputer programmers love Chomsky, because it makes parsing English quite easy, and quite a bit like algebra. (Chomksy even uses math-inspired notations).\n\nHowever, I believe that since the book was written, the idea of generative grammar (while providing a useful analytic tool) isn't very representative of the way people learn language.\n\nLinguists now tend to favour statistical models, I believe. For instance, many children tend to learn the word \"water\" very early, as it is the one they hear most often, and very often in proximity of actual water, making the semantic association between the word and the object obvious.", "The other thing about it is that it's not mysterious at all. I mean, you just typed that question rule example, and a bunch of non-linguists read it and went \"well, duh\". The fact that a specifically contrived \"question rule\" breaks down in an equally specifically contrived example is only mysterious to people who've started with the assumption that a grammar can and should be formalised into a bunch of generative rules. And yet all the \"rules\" of language are completely transparent to the most average lay human being, in the sense that they can apply them flawlessly (by definition) without bringing them to consciousness. And late Wittgenstein said as much, and said that we should all stop stressing about it. And isn't that interesting? Yes, it is. \n\nOf course, that doesn't help in actually de-mystifying it at all. But the particular mystery you mentioned is sort of self-creating. The mystery arises from the attempt to create a piece of theory that works. What's far less clear is how to evaluate the effectiveness of the theories we come up with, when we're continually finding examples that break them. We don't even know which part of our attempt at theory is misguided. But I guess that's scientific method for you. Yeah? \n\nI'm pretty sure mental grammars aren't generative, in the sense that the generative formalisations aren't tangibly represented anywhere in the brain. It's just that theorists are trying to extract them post-hoc, and that's why it's so hard. I'm pretty sure that the drivers of actual human linguistic competence are another sort of machinery altogether. But then the science is still at a state where nobody really knows what all these words mean.

Same with why people don't like reading. They're conditioned to hate it by virtue of it ruining lives.", "I've spoken about this at length, but the issue isn't just the recitation of math, but is threefold\n\nThe first is, as you pointed out, is the approach.  Currently, we don't approach math from a learning standpoint, but that math consists solely of trigonometry, geometry, and arithmetic.  There's some other offshoots, but they're more \"not-math\" and not worth our time.  This leads to a premise that all math is known, there's no unique problems, and that it's effectively dead.  Because of that, it's easy enough to convince kids to just memorize multiplication tables and not have any understanding of how something works.\n\nThis leads to the second problem - the methodology.  If you actually teach math as if it was an investigative science and that no, not everything in math is known, we could have a bit of a better education pertaining to it.  Specifically, if we can encourage kids with their whys and their hows to ask that in math, you can actually start educating them on math, what it is, and how it functions.\n\nFinally, the last point is that math is not easily put into a time pressure situation.  Yes, some problems can easily be dealt with in short periods of time (Test lengths), but ultimately, as you get into math, trying to solve problems in short periods of time is hard, wrong, and won't produce the best results.  Math is something to be ruminated on, tried, tested, and found out that it's the wrong approach.  I was once told that math in school nowadays (including and not limited to high school/university) is that you are given a mountain, called a math problem.  You are told to dig a tunnel through to the other side, and given a giant blasting kit, and some other tunnel digging tools.  You know the solution and where to go (roughly speaking).  Math, in a research world, is more like staring at a rock face, told to try to find the other side, not knowing what side it is, and that you have your bare hands to dig the tunnel.  You don't know where to go, and what side you'll come out on.  \n\nSo yes.  Math needs reformation.  Math needs to be taught as if it's a logic class, not a memorization class.", "&gt;Why don't people like math? \n\n[Because it's taught all wrong](http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf).

It is by all odds America's masterpiece. Boys, I have looked for this mountain all my life but I never expected to find it in this world. This mountain is the Great White Throne.\"\n\nIt's pretty much visible from most of zions and it is *enormous*.

You can take trolleys around because parking gets expensive! \n\nTake I-35 N and go to Austin (1 hr &amp; 20 mins ish). During the Day there is lots of historical stuff to do with the kids, lots of food/artists/music.

Sit on the roof top bar and watch the crazies.\n\nFrom here you'll have to chose: nature lover? Head west, the drive will be long but we have a pretty diverse state. Wanna hit another metro and get out? Take I-35 north to DFW (2 hours &amp; 45minsish). If you stay in Arlington you can hit six flags (but don't stay near there) and see the stadium Jerry built. Ft Worth has sundance square which is artistic with bass hall etc and the stockyards. Also a great zoo and science museum. Hit Dalls for a more...city experience? There are some famous sites (where JFK was shot) and lots of shopping, posh food etc.\n\nFrom there I would take I-35 to OK and then 40W to NM.\n\nHope that helps!!

I loved the other superhero cartoons, all of them: Batman TAS, Superman TAS, Justice League, JLU, Teen Titans. Young Justice was the successor to all of them, and was well on its way to exceeding its \"heritage.\"\n\nThe characters were complex, three-dimensional, flawed, broken, spectacular. The storylines were bold and ambitious. Episodes were powerful on their own, entertaining on their own, funny and exciting on their own. But better was the fact that they built upon each other, often in ways that were that perfect combination of television storytelling in that they were both surprising and inevitable.\n\nAnd this is something that matters a lot to me personally: the characters were diverse, in race and gender. A lot of times you look at the worlds of these old properties, built up in the 1920s and 1950s, and it's instantly obvious that they were formed in the era of segregation. Even the newer comics in the 60s and 70s that tried to be progressive are laughably dated by characters with names like \"Black Vulcan,\" \"Apache Chief,\" and \"Katana.\" \n\nBut Young Justice carried the torch of comic greats like the late Dwayne McDuffie, and updated their stories and characters to reflect the real richness of modern American society. Because that's more real.\n\nAnd it reflects the kids growing up watching the show. When Justice League chose John Stewart over Hal Jordan, they made *the* Green Lantern a black man for a whole generation of kids. It seems like a small thing. But it means everything to kids who don't usually see heroes who look like their fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters on-screen. And YJ continued that tradition.\n\nAnd now that show's gone and who knows when another show'll come along like it to carry the torch.

What lands on my side, I keep. What lands on the other side,  I give to God.\"\n\nThe protestant priest replies, \"similarly,  I draw a circle on the ground and stand in it. I throw the money in the air, and what stays in the circle is mine. What lands on the outside of the circle is God's.\"\n\nThe Rabbi finishes his drink, gently places his glass on the bar and says, \"I throw all the money in the air... whatever God catches he can keep.\"", "\"Viva la France\"?", "It's franish.", "*Vive, sorry.

The good news is that you get one last request, and you can request anything, which we will fulfill before you die.\" \n\n&gt;The Englishman, who is chosen for sacrifice first, asks to read the complete works of Shakespere, one last time before he is killed.  He assumes there is no way that this village has access to the voluminous works of Shakespere, even if some missionary had brought them a copy of Romeo and Juliet or King Lear. They'll have to let him live while they try to get a copy and that will give him time to figure out how to escape. But while the Englishmen is chuckling to himself about how clever he is, a tribesman leads him into a hut behind the chief's tent, which is filled with books.  The tribesman walks the Englishman over to the Shakespere section and brings him a stool.  The Englisman is shocked, but begins reading.  After a week he has read all of the greater and lesser works of Shakespere.  He resolves that death is a noble part of life and that this death can only make for a great story.  The tribesmen kill him, and make his skin into a canoe.  \n\n&gt;The Frenchman sees the Englisman's plot, and his fate, and resolves that he can do it better.  He tells the cheif that he wants a tryst with a blonde, a redhead, and a brunette--nautural beauties with no dyes or embellishments. \"Honh, honh\" he giggles to himself--there are only island girls here, while they try to organize my foursome, I can find out how to get off this island.  But no sooner can the Frenchman make his demands than the cheifs harem, of the most beautiful women from around the world, is paraded out in front of Jacque.  He raises his eyebrows and admits to himself that it is still a great last request. A day and a half later, exhausted and dehydrated, the frenchman stumbles out of the tent to submit to his execution, be skinned and made into a canoe.\n\n&gt;The American, seemingly oblivious to the other's attempts to delay death, demands a fork. The natives are confused, but they hand over a fork. He starts stabbing himself all over with said fork... his arms, legs, torso, everywhere. \n\n&gt;\"What are you doing?!\" The chief asks finally, perplexed. The American grins at them. \n\n&gt;\"So much for your canoe, you assholes.\" \n", "&gt;  \"Honh, honh!\" he giggles to himself\n\nLost it right there.\n\n", "The problem with this version is that the Frenchman still comes out ontop.

This was not your ordinary wasp though-he was smart, philosophical even. One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him. \nHe goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it. \nOf course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp’s departure, but they all know it’s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there’s an extremely long line. He decides it’s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he’s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it’s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but what do you know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch.

This means a larger incentive for illegal activity to make new jobs outside of corporate consumerism. We'd see turf wars over sales and jobs. Raw resource gathering/refinement would become run by unofficial mafias. (you want to work for the lumber mill? Go talk to Great grandfather Pete of the Smiths from 4th street. He is the husband to the hiring managers daughter, and can get the manager to hire whomever he wants.) \n\nExisting transportation can not accommodate that many people going in so many directions.

Ideas change over time.. we've had the civil rights marches of the sixties and currently we're seeing heated debate and slow acceptance of gay marriage. In a century no doubt gay marriage will be as normal as any other kind of marriage, but it takes time for these ideas to take root and there's no better way for things to do that than to see that when it's in action that it's not going to cause the collapse of society and in many ways it's beneficial. \n\nIf people suddenly lived a lot longer.. imagine if some of the people walking around today can remember owning slaves.

Listen up, there's no despair.\n\nOnce upon a time I was with my friend Mohammed and we were indulging in the greasy contents of cafeteria foods. As one must be well aware of, studies have shown that the contents of such food is mainly comprised of dirt and dirt and dirt. Following our sizeable lunch, I felt a rumbling in my lower tummy that alerted me in no uncertain terms that indeed a non-negligable fart was brewing. Now I, being on good terms with my sphincter, was able to coerce it it squeeze tight for a more appropriate time.... A more appropriate time for hilarity that it. With a jovial face, I leaned towards Mohammed to alert him of the devious fart plot brewing in my twisted mind.\n\n*whisper whisper whisper*\n\nWe took to the campus library, a sharp pang coursing through my bowels. With much haste we entered the sacred silence of the library, glancing at the studious folk who were striving for their polymath education. Little did they know the horrors I was about to unleash on them. I began to walk down the busiest isle, letting out a silent but deadly fart out my anus and allowing the poisonous odours to penetrate the air in a thick haze. I do not like to blow my own horn my dear friend but it must be known that the smell which radiated from my flatulance was incredible to say the least. It had a kind of mass and thickness to it and smelled like the rotting corpse of a demon straight from hell. Why I'm sure satan himself, if he were present on that day, would turn to me and say 'this is unacceptable'. It was the kind of fart that makes you fear that perhaps you had a tod of rotting flesh in your intestines. It was a fart that would cause concerns for doctors. \n\nAs the smell amplified and shone its glory on my victims, they slowly began to lift their noses from their books, in utter disbelief at the evils that they had been cursed with. What had they done to deserve this? One by one they searched around for the culprit, only to become suspects themsleves. For some, it became unbearable and dry heaving began while others resorted to burying their undeserving noses in their shirtsm No doubt in my mind each and all of them questioned whether anyone of stable health could produce such a disgusting fetid smell. By this time my friend Mohammed and I were crouched behind the photocopier, laughing at our evil deeds like cretins. 'Oh dear,' Mohammed said, 'you didn't poop but you might as well have, for the disgraceful smell you have emitted is just as toxic. I doubt that man was ever meant to produce such deadliness.' I just shook my head and grinned, giving Mohammed a knowing wink.\n\nBut my mischief was not done as yet. It has always been said that there is no honour amongst thieves. At that moment Mohammed looked at me with a stare like [THIS](http://cdn.head-fi.org/7/7e/900x900px-LL-7ee0ca37_BertStare.jpg) for he knew that he had dealt with the brunt of a double edged sword. I had CROP DUSTED him as well. His eyes began to water as his lungs became impregnated with the anacoda that was my floating fecal particles. He didn't bother to choke and gag for he knew there was no escaping a fart of this magnitude. He simply excused himself and said, 'never have I suffered such an injustice. It feels like you have literally defacated in my lungs . This is sinful. I would advise you to see a doctor for this cannot be the product of a long-living man. I disaprove and retire from your company.'

Its easy to have a lot of bravado when war is something you go and do somewhere else on your terms whenever and however you please safe in the knowledge that it wont have any consequences for the loved ones at home. Its a whole another mater when war is on your doorstep. In your home. You family suffering, you not knowing if they are dead or alive or how any of you is gonna survive the next day. \n\nI am wondering how Americans would handle an invasion. They like to think that they would wave their guns around and the invaders would be taken care of, but when the realities of war sets in I am not sure such an untested populace would be able to handle the shock. No food, no grocery, no electricity no infrastructure, no nothing. Death could get you at any time. I wonder then if their guns would help them or quicken the way to anarchy.\n\nEither way, If I was ever gonna take on the US in a war I would make it my top priority to land troops on the continent and fuck up infrastructure. ", "I'm from the UK and have heard many war stories from my elders over the years because I used to work for elderly residents doing carpentry and odd jobs. Here are some of the best:\n\n1 - Demolitions\n\nA man whose house I was working on as a carpenter told me about his time working with a demolitions unit in Berlin after the end of the war. They were searching through buildings, looking for boobytraps and part of his duty included looking behind pictures for boobytraps which required tipping the picture to one side and checking for wires. A terrifying job by any stretch of the imagination, especially as the war was over and everyone just wanted to get back home. One of the ways he and his squad would cope with the horror and stress would be by making light of the whole thing, pretending it was a big joke.\n\nSo he's on the third floor of a big mansion house once the property of an officer, looking behind pictures. In walks his sergeant but the guy doesn't hear him enter the room. So the sarge stands there for a bit watching him peek behind one picture after another, waits for his moment then claps his hands together and yells \"BANG!\"\n\nThe squaddie screamed, ran across the room and jumped out the window. Broke his ankle and was sent home with his injury. \n\n2 - Under the Arches\n\nI would often ask about the war and what experiences the old folk had had. One lady told me she'd loved the war because the whole thing had been so thrilling. She'd been about 9 or 10 at the time and was cycling home through a suburb of Bristol when the sirens sounded for a raid. She managed to get to an underground station (not a train station, can't remember exactly where or what it was) and huddled there for a night, listening to the old folk sing songs, tell stories and cosying up under blankets while the bombs fell above ground. When she got home the next day her mother was so amazed she was alive she screamed with delight then slapped her face for putting her through it. This little old lady's eyes sparkled while she recounted the story. She lived alone on the twelfth floor of a block of flats, never went out (too scared of teenagers) and the only company she got was meals-on-wheels and the telly. \n\n3 - Delivering the Mail\n\nMy Grandpa didn't fight but was responsible for delivering mail, provisions, ammo and other items to troops overseas, on the front line and even at home. He would sit in the back of a big aircraft (can't remember the name) then shove sacks and crates out at the right point.\n\nOver the front line this was a terrifying prospect and quite often supplies were accidentally thrown out too soon or too late because the plane was off course, avoiding AAGs, or weaving through flak. He told me a lot of stuff wound up in rivers or the sea because the pilots lost their nerve.\n\nHis favourite story was the time they flew low over a relatively quiet frontline area in France and dropped crates on chutes. The Germans fired on them, but the plane was well out of range, then someone fires a flare. Grandpa was never sure if the flare was friendly fire (trying to get the plane's attention) or from the Germans, but whichever it was, the flare came in through the open door of the plane and lit up the inside with what he called 'the greatest fireworks display I ever saw'. He always had a good chuckle, but I imagine it was terrifying, as was the whole experience for him. He lost all his hair during the war and when he came home was a shadow of his former self.\n\n", "That was awesome, except the part where the old lady was too afraid to go out because of teenagers. This makes me so sad. I mean sure teenagers are scary angsty - full of hormones - people, but in general they are OK. But I get why she would fear them, there are those teenagers out there that would fuck with an old lady just because, and that breaks my heart. The exact opposite should be true, old people should love going outside *because* teenagers respect them and will help them out. \n\nAnyway, just a little rant. ", "Sadly, the media don't help by portraying older people as being in constant danger.  The reality is that old ladies are probably the safest group in society because it takes a real scumbag to want to harm one.  The majority of people would see violence against them as beyond the pale, even those individuals who regularly get into fights or cause trouble.\n\nThere have been studies that show that older people massively over-estimate their risk of violent attack while teenagers, and young men in particular, massively under-estimate the dangers they face.", "I think it's to do with the fact that young men believe that if they were to have a confrontation with somebody that they could defend themselves easily. Elderly women know that if they were to have a confrontation with somebody that they would have no way to defend themselves. Both groups have an inaccurate expectation of their risks of being made a victim.", "&gt; The majority of people would see violence against them as beyond the pale, even those individuals who regularly get into fights or cause trouble.\n\nThis is making me giggle because my 97 year old nana is one of those old ladies who just loves to talk. She's lived in the same home for over 60 years and knows everyone, even the pants-hanging-off-their-asses teenage ganstas in training. It cracks me up watching them code switch from that to \"Yes, Ms. Nellie, I will bring you your mail and rake up your leaves.\" It's just really sweet the amount of respect they show her. Her yard is her \"thing\" and I just can't imagine them even littering in it. She doesn't live in a rich neighborhood or anything but she is well known.

She grew up in Coventry, the middle of 5 sisters. She was about 12 when the war broke out and she used to tell me about how whenever her and her sisters evacuated they did everything to get back to Coventry, despite it basically being rubble. \n\nI remember her saying how even at that age (I guess 13ish when she was 1st evacuated) she felt like she was somehow leaving her post whenever she was made to leave. She had stories about jumping on a train in Devon at 3am just to get back to her remaining family to be with them, but also for the sense of cameraderie that everyone had. \n\nEventually she got a job in a factory with some of her sisters but one day she didn't go to work because of an illness and that day her factory was bombed, killing 2 of her sisters. she always maintained that they would have preferred that than living quietly in the countryside.

I think that those are very important variables that make a significant impact on our reprisal and resistance options.\n\nI, actually, think the first *Red Dawn* had the most realistic depiction of foreign boots on our soil with the land invasion coming up from Mexico.  So, let's say our alliances have crumbled, Venezuela, Bolivia and Cuba all start getting massive backing from Russia, and we are close to a condition of civil war.  Even then, the country is three significant geographic regions.  The Mississippi River is hard to cross, and so are the Rocky Mountains.  Holding either coast would be difficult just out of size alone, so possibly hold the interior?  I really can't see how these troops aren't getting bombed back into puberty by flights of BUFFs, but we are imaging that the Air Force and Air National Guard are grounded for some reason.  \n\nI think it takes a *lot* of tanks and soldiers to invade and hold Texas.  As in, a stupid amount.  If, for no other reason, than the attrition rates would most likely be excessive.  I've known Texans to be rather ... proud of their state.\n\nThe West Coast is difficult to hold because of the size and variety of terrain of California.  The desert states might be easier to hold because of their spread out populated areas, but I think the Northwest would have a significant armed insurrection.  There are lots of outdoorsy types with AR-15s from San Francisco, all of Oregon, Washington and Idaho.  I would also expect any assistance to be coming in through the northern border, since it is extremely porous.\n\nThe East Coast poses interesting problems, because of, again, the variety of terrain.  However, a war has already been fought there, and those battle plans have long since been made public.  Any commander should know how to march troops and place tanks in a place that has already seen war.  I think the insurrection in New York would be stifling.  It's a very large city, and it's people know it well.\n\nThat being said, I think that in all three of those regions our armed forces stand a solid chance of prevailing.  I still don't know the scenario that our military has been rendered inoperable (I would expect them to instill massive losses on the enemy), so it's hard to speculate.  But after that, I don't see our (heavily armed) population being very receptive to foreign troops.  We don't seem to do well with our *own* government telling us what to do.

The first one my grandfather told me several times when he lived and we talked about it a lot.\n\nWhere my grandparents lived in the Netherlands, the countryside, the people had to give food and shelter to, at least, two  German soldiers per household. My grandpa always said Hitler didn’t have the money to pay for that stuff. Alas, two soldiers arrived at their house and my grandparents let them in. One of my uncles was a newborn and in his cradle. One of the soldiers walked upto it, fell to his knees and started to cry. My grandparents tried to comfort him, allthough they were scared, and asked him what was wrong. He told them he had a wife and two young children at home and wanted to be with them. My grandfather asked him why he joined the army. The soldier answered that „no“ was not the right answer when a gun is pointed to your head, while being „asked“ to join the army. The other soldier agreed on that. They both went out of their way to help my family out with food and such, as did my family for them, understanding they all had no choice.\n\nThe second story is from a lady I met when I volunteered at an old peoples home in a town nearby where I live now.\n\nWe were sitting on the terras near the petanque fields and drank a beer. I asked her what Belgium was like during the war. She told me she was deported as a worker to Dresden (Germany) to work in a factory where they assembled bombs and bullets. Note: no volunteering there, mind you. At the end of the war, when Germany already was capitulating to the allied forces, the Americans decided it was a great idea to bomb the living hell out of all major cities in Germany. Also Dresden. No brick was left on top of another and thousandqs upon thousands of innocent people were killed in those raids. Children, women, men, just innocent people who had nothing to do with anything of that war, that mostly despised it and didn’t want the Nazis to be there, were killed. She told me that she hated every country that took part in those raids, because she survived a massacre that was done „just because they could“.\n\nTL;DR: there are no heroes in any war. Just losers.", "And a huge pile of assholes on the political top, letting the wars happen and steering them towards the nightmares they become.", "My father was in the army over there after the war.

I know that he went to Sweden, was trained by Americans to become a police officer and then went back to Norway. One day we were listening to the radio when a program came on about the Norwegian resistance and how Sweden helped by training them as \"police officers\". He quickly shut off the radio and it was never talked about again.\n\nWhen I went in for my army training, which was mandatory at the time, my Grandfather and dad brought me to the bus that early, cold morning and I'll never forget when my Grandfather with tears in his eyes shook my hand and said \"I hope this will be the most useless year of your life\".

The house across the street where his friend lived got blown to shreds. He and his 4 sisters ran downstairs and hid in closets and under the tables of their lower neighbours. That same day he and two of the sisters were put on a truck that delivered goods to my great grandfather's store. He had asked his friend and co-worker to drive them up North to Groningen.

He saw nothing but rubble and bodies, sometimes covered by blankets. \n\nHe was dropped in rural Groningen with little directions and separated from the two sisters. The dialect of Groningen was so different from Rotterdam at the time that my grandfather couldn't even tell people where he was from. He only had a letter from his dad. He let me see the letter.

He still has loads at his home. \n\nAfter the war was officially over and the Hunger Winter passed he went home in 1946. He found his family in Amsterdam.

It's almost as bad as *hubby*.", "Waifu", "I wondered whether I should still contribute something to this, but the topic is near and dear to my heart.\n\nAt first, there was no distinction between veterans and everyone else. Towards the end of the war, the country had a near 100% conscription rate for men between 16 and 60. Nearly everybody was in the war, and who wasn't witnessed the downfall in their own neighborhoods, with bombing raids and allied occupation troops in every part of Germany besides the most rural areas. Every man that was still alive - we lost a tenth of our population, and every sixth man was dead, captured or maimed - was a veteran, or had to be able to explain why he wasn't. Women worked our industry and anti-aircraft batteries during the war, because every man that could hold a gun was sent east or west to fight a lost and wrong cause.\n\nAfter the war, the country suffered from collective PTSD. I am sure some of you have friends or family, or maybe yourself, that have been in Iraq or Afghanistan, and maybe have witnessed the devastating effect of the mental disorders that come with fighting a war. Now, I mean absolutely no offense and do not mean to diminish the suffering of today's veterans - but the conflicts fought today are pretty much children's birthday parties if compared to the world igniting horror of World War II. Imagine a whole population having experienced this, with no such thing as psychological counseling or even just psychiatric medication.\n\nWe were a broken, defeated, extinguished people in 1945. 60 million human beings suffering from PTSD. And knowing that not only did you lose the war, but also that you were on the wrong side. On the wrong side of morality, of humanity, of history. We were the bad guys. There was no pride. Just the knowledge that we were at rock bottom, and rightfully so.\n\nSo no, there was no special treatment for veterans. Just the comfort those that experienced the war together were able to give to each other. Telling stories to children, who after the economic miracle of the 1950s and 60s (in no small part made possible by the Marshal plan and the open arms of the international community) already had no possible understanding for what had just a couple of years ago happened.\n\nAnd then the 60s were coming to their end, and the children born after the war were coming of age. And they started to ask questions. You see, after the war, nobody had done anything really bad. Sure, some had, and they hanged in Nuremberg. But me? No, of course not! I wasn't in the SS! I was just doing what we had to do in war! That was the sentiment of everyone who was in the war. And it just did not add up. 20 million people don't just die by themselves. The question: \"What did you do during the war?\" became the central crux for the relationship between two generations. And where the answers were dissatisfying, it broke. The student protests of 1968 and the following left-wing terrorism by the RAF during the 70s came up mostly because a young generation was horrified and angry that a generation of murderers still held power in the young Bundesrepublik. Veterans were not honored outside the circles of the Ewig-Gestrigen, they were silently loathed.\n\nBy now, the last veterans of the war are dying. If you were conscripted in the last days of the Battle of Berlin, you are today at least 80 years old. My generation - I turned 30 this year - knows of the war only from stories of our grandparents, and from the ever-present historic reminders. In no other country on Earth will you be taught as much about Nazi Germany in schools, or see as many documentaries about it on TV, or have it so ingrained into our culture and arts. My generation knows; but while most people can get very angry with their parents, it is hard to be the same way with your old grandpa. The sentiment has changed once more.\n\nMy mother's father was an anti-aircraft gunner, he was captured in France and spent the last months of the war in an American POW camp near Boston. He got lucky by having an inguinal hernia just in time to avoid being sent to the eastern front earlier.\nMy father's father was a tank driver, in a very small, hardly armored Schützenpanzer on the eastern front. He told stories of how they would fell trees and pull them on chains behind their tank, so that the enemy would think their tank to be much bigger. He got captured by the Red Army in the winter of '45, and told stories of how their guards would start burning parts of the POW camp's buildings for warmth. He got lucky, and fled in a daring escape, that probably sounded much more adventurous in his stories than in reality.\n\nMy granduncle was in the SS. He joined the nazi party in the 20s. He was an SA officer, and then an SS officer, and then he fell on the retreat from Treblinka.\n\nGood riddance.\n\nGood riddance not only of the few people of that time that deserved the downfall and their own demise. But good riddance of the very idea that they fought for. The propaganda. The militarism. The heroism. The love of people and country that turned into hate for everything else. And, yes, the glorification of the soldier and the veteran.\n\nWe shed ourselves of this, and we paid a unimaginable price for it (and, even more so, made others pay it for us). By being the most mentally disturbed people in the world at one time in history, we might now, after decades of self-administered psychotherapy, be one of the most sane.\n\n**TL;DR: After suffering from nationwide PTSD, we changed for the better.**\n\nCustomary Post-Scriptum Edit: Thank you very much for the positive resonance, and for my very first gold! Did not expect that!", "I wish you thousands more upvotes, because your post deserves them. \n\nI'm a little older than you, but I agree with every word. I've been thinking about writing this, and am a little hesitant. So I'll bury it here, where not many will see it. \n\nBoth my grandfathers were in the war, of course. \nOne was younger and got drafted in '40. For his troubles, he came home with an alcohol problem and tuberculosis he caught in a POW camp. I never met him. He had 3 children with the wife he beat during one of his \"episodes\" and died shortly after the youngest was born, leaving a young widow with 3 small children and 3 elderly relatives, with no money, to fend for herself. \n\nThe other one served from the first day to the last, poor sod, and then was a POW for 2 years (luckily with the Americans). He had shrapnel in his body for the rest of his life, caught Malaria in the Russian swamps or maybe in Africa with Rommel, that plagued him until he was an old man and had to have half his stomach removed because he had so many stomach ulcers. Lost a toe in the snow in Norway. \n\nHe came home, knocked up the wrong girl, married her. Poor family, always, so he started working. Hard. Between the small farm with his old parents, a wife he never really liked and god knows what sort of memories, he proceeded to take it out on his children. For years and years. \n\nI was his first grandchild and he loved me so much. For some reason, I was his \"project\" - he told me his war stories, first the funny ones and then, the older I got, they got more and more terrible. \"Don't forget\", he'd say, \"but don't tell anyone about this\". He was so ashamed. And so angry, still, 40, 50 years later. \"They took my best years, those fucking Nazis\". \"Fucking Nazis (Scheiß-Nazis\", Drecks-Nazis) - we must look out for them; it can happen again.\" \"Beware!\" \"Pay attention to politics! Speak up!\" \"We couldn't stop them (he was a staunch social democrat), maybe you can, next time.\" I had it hammered into my brain, over and over and over. \n\nWhen he got really old, his temper returned. His wife died, he spend a lot of time alone, on his little farm or in his garden. The guy who owned the garden next to him - they had grown up together. Actually, they met, in the middle of the war, somewhere in a Italian forest and were friends for life, literally. When his buddy was put into an old people's home, he was even more alone. And I believe that the memories came back with a vengeance. And with them, the temper. He lost it sometimes, started shouting, pointing knives at people. Imagine, an 85 year old man, who barely managed the stairs, jumping up, standing in your kitchen, with a knife in his hand, shouting at you. What can you do but laugh in his face? \n\nOne day, he didn't get up. A week later, he was dead. In that week, we had to give him morphine, because, as he drifted away, he re-lived his life. His mother. His favourite sister. And the war, the war, the war. Our minister said, when we buried him, that many of the old men in our village had gone through the war, but none had taken it as hard as him. \"The defining event of his entire life\", he called it.\n\n\nSo, no. We never were taught to thank our veterans, because the one that taught me about war thought there was nothing to be proud of, apart from coming home alive. \n\nMany years later, one of my cousins (other side of the family) had 2 tours in Afghanistan. He doesn't want to be thanked. But he gives talks, explaining what it's like and that there is no glory in war. I'm so proud of him for this, and so would my grandfather be. \n\n**TL;DR: There is no reason to be proud of them, other than for coming home.**\n ", "&gt; By being the most mentally disturbed people in the world at one time in history, we might now, after decades of self-administered psychotherapy, be one of the most sane.\n\nWhich is why I love Germans.

He was assigned to one of the concentration camps. He worked there for a very short time after asking for a transfer to the battle as he couldn't bear the work at the camp. \n\nHe once invited my great grandfather to visit him at the camp. He previously didn't even know of the existence of such camps, and was completely shocked and disillusioned after that experience, cam home, and destroyed all of the NSDAP-crap he had received. \n\nFrom that point onwards he had to be afraid of his own son who was still active in the Nazi party and would have possibly told on his father at that time. So he never told anyone about his experience at the concentration camp until the war was over. My great grandfather was too young to serve in WWI and too old to serve in WWII, so he got lucky concerning the whole fighting thing, but he was one of the silent mass not in support of the Nazis, but too afraid to do something about it, only silently protesting in private. \n\nMy granddad was supposed to join the Volkssturm in 45, defending Berlin. \nHe is from an area around 600km away from Berlin, and was 14 or 15 at the time. Being a good shot, he was called into training (just as any other 14 or 15 year old boy would be at that time). \n\nThe person giving them basic training was a family friend and he knew that my grandfather was pretty good with a gun. So he told him that he shouldn't be shooting on-target all that much because in that case, he would be made a sniper, a very, very dangerous position from which not many people would return. \n\nSo he always shot slightly off target, but still managed to always hit the same spot slightly to the left of the target, after which he got another tip to mix it up a bit. \n\nAnyways.. a few days later, they were all loaded onto trains that were going to be sent off to Berlin. The railroads were partially destroyed, so the trains had to stop a lot and have road workers fix the rails so that the train could pass. \n\nDuring those stops, they had to hide next to the trains whenever a fighter plane came and shot the trains with machine guns. Right before they were to be handed their soliders' pass, my grandfather and a friend of his fled the scene. This was about 50km away from home, in the middle of nowhere, right before the end of the war. \n\nThey marched for a long time, both being hungry and tired. Then, in the middle of the forrest, and this sounds like a made-up story, but my grandfather swears to it, they met two women, mother and daughter, who gave them some bread and water to eat. After this, they felt a lot better and continued their journey, finally arriving back home, still in their Hitlerjugend- Uniform. \n\nThey had to be kept in hiding for a couple of weeks, but then the war was over and they were still alive. \n\n\n**TL;DR** Almost all Germans had good and bad guys in their family during the Nazi- Period.

There have been many stories over the years about old enemies meeting each other at such gatherings in Germany. In recent years, I'm sure it's fallen off simply because there aren't as many veterans left. Furthermore, it seems to me that veterans in Germany aren't nearly as glorified in general as in other places, especially the US.

They place the blame on the German leadership, the Gestapo (secret police), and the SS (major Nazi paramilitary organization), all of which are known for being pretty evil.\n\nThe war itself, as well as the atrocities involved with it, are viewed with great shame by many Germans––perhaps less so by the younger generation, who are temporally quite far removed from the events therein, but who do typically view themselves as very responsible for ensuring nothing like it ever happens in this country again. (There are occasionally Nazi marches and rallies, and the corresponding anti-Nazi counter-protest is typically much more well attended, including many young people.) Shifting the blame onto the leadership and the SS is kind of convenient, though.\n\nMost members of the Wehrmacht saw themselves as doing their duty for their country and didn't necessarily want to be evil assholes or subscribe too tightly to the Nazi ideology. However, we know for a fact that members of the Wehrmacht were guilty of many serious war crimes just like the SS was. The \"SS bad, Wehrmacht neutral\" line of thought has in some ways been eroded as this evidence has come to light, but it's still the dominant position.\n\nTake this as a lesson of war––otherwise ordinary or even upstanding people can be turned into soulless monsters by the stress of war.", "Both my grandfathers fought in WW2. The one i got to get to know was a pilot in the Luftwaffe.

I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be proud of him or dislike him because of that. After all he was 18 years old, just out of school, \"brave\" enough to get into a ME-109 and risk his life (for whatever he thought was the right reason).", "My maternal grandfather turned 18 on December 27th 1943. He was sent to the German island of Rügen to become a pilot for the Luftwaffe. He only had about 10 flying lessons on the Bücker Jungmann and Bücker Bestmann, before they ran out of fuel for training to continue (that's how he told it). Grandfather was then sent to Italy (untrained, 18 years old), to fight with the 1st parachute division, the \"green devils\", the heroes of Narvik, Rotterdam, Crete and so on... He joined them right after the battle of Monte Cassino, so he probably got around the worst, but he got subsequently shot in the arm when fighting near Bologna. That's how became and American POW and witnessed the rest of the war in a camp near Lake Garda. \n\nAfter the war he returned to his home city of Stolberg and became a teacher in Duisburg afterwards. There he met my grandmother, who had fled from the then German city Königsberg (today Kaliningrad, Poland) from the Red Army. She often told me about the nights in air raid shelters and the hard times after the war, how they had to rebuild the city with almost nothing to eat... She also often told me about the first time she saw a \"Neger\" (negro). He was sitting on one of the tanks passing through Duisburg. She was both fearful and excited. The soldiers also gave her chocolate and chewing gum, the latter which she had never tasted in her life. \n\nBoth talk very badly of hitler and considering how young both were during this time (My grandfather 19 and my grandmother 15 in 1945) I am glad they are not as \"guilty\" as others. \n\nI never got to meet my paternal grandfather, he had a fatal car crash in the 60's, so I don't know what he did during the war.It's rumored that he was an alcoholic. My paternal grandmother talks alot about the \"Flucht\" in '45 when she and her family fled from Poland (then Germany). When the Red Army was closing in on their farm, she, her sisters and her cousins hid in the pile of hay that was stored in the barn. The soldiers found her and raped her over the course of a week. Both her brothers had died on the eastern front. Her cousin and dad were taken outside of their kitchen in '46 by Russian officers and then shot as well. Their farm was given to polish settlers and they had to leave with almost nothing.\n\nNone of my relatives have ever used the word veterans for someone involved in WW2. It's very uncommon and frowned upon in Germany to express some sort of respect for these people and I do not think that it's a bad thing. However, I am sure that every German child has learned a lot about the hardships during and after the war and has been asked (almost begged in my case) to never let something like that happen again. ", "This is probably going to be buried, but I might as well put my two cents in anyway. :P\n\nI think a lot of people are correct in saying that the experience for WWII veterans in Europe was much the same for everybody, regardless of German, British, French, etc; it was all pretty damned horrible for everyone involved. In Germany in particular, the war came right up to their doorstep in the worst ways imaginable: it was a total, calamitous defeat.\n\nI think a much more interesting (politically speaking) viewing of veterans can be seen in Japan however, where the way veterans of WWII are viewed is still an *extremely* controversial topic. One of the shrines in Japan venerating the war dead (Yasukuni Shrine) in particular causes vast amounts of political tension between Japan and the rest of Far-East Asia. In fact, whether or not you support the troops during WWII can cause a pretty significant splitting of opinions in Japan and other Asian countries\n\nSee, right after that war, there have been rather different results in Germany and Japan; while Germany was occupied completely and the Nazi regime destroyed, Japan's government remained largely in tact. Furthermore (and more importantly), the Cold War caused a very different shift: while much of Germany (West Germany at least) quickly tried to improve relations with the rest of Europe (the creation of the EU later onwards only emphasised this), in Japan, things were very different: the vast majority of Far East Asia joined the Soviets in the Communist block, Japan became the beacon of *Capitalism* in the region, and thus worked to improve relations with *America* rather than Asia.\n\nBecause of this, much of the controversial actions that Japan took in Asia during the war (e.g. the Machurian Incident) went un-accounted for; the combination of a continuous post-war government and splitting of ideologies during Cold War meant that, unlike Germany, Japan ended up extremely divided from the rest of Asia, and the repercussions of that can be felt even today, with Japanese politicians saying some *really* stupid stuff about WWII (particularly about Korea and comfort women, more recently), and, as are well known, many anti-Japanese protests going on in China. Even the recent Senkaku Island debate could be linked to the bad relations between China and Japan, resulting from their historic split since WWII.", "Maybe someone will read this: \nAs already pointed out in this thread, pretty much everyone in Germany was at war. I can contribute to this thread by telling the story of my family.\n\nI will begin with my mother's family:\nMy grandmother was born in 1935, therefore she was pretty young when the war took place and only 10 years old when the war ended because Germany surrendered. From her point of view (she lived in a small village, that is why they were seldom the target of air raids) the time after the war was worse.\n\nThey did not have a lot of foot and till today she refuses to eat certain vegetables, because they remind her of \"the bad time\" (\"Die schlechte Zeit\"). She had a 19 year old brother who was sent to Russia and was taken prisoner. He died a few years afterwards because of Typhus. \n\nHer father was the local leader of the NSDAP (Hitler's party) and eventhough my grandma claims that he did not do anything wrong, he hid for three years after the war while his sister was imprisoned instead of him.\n\nMy grandfather was 15 when he had to leave school in order to help at the anti-aircraft guns in Hamburg. Unfortunatly I don't know anything else about his fate, except that his parents were both dead when he was 20 years old. But I am not sure if this was caused by the war. \n\n\nMy father's family has a different background.\nMy grandfather came from east-germany ( now Poland) and fled to west germany because the russians were coming. He did not talk alot about the war, but he had to fight when he was 16 years old and was taken prisoner by the Americans or Brits and held captive in the Netherlands. \n\nEventhough he was very right winged till his death ( you could say he was a still a nazi in his mind), he never wore an uniform again, because he said \"the last time I wore an uniform, it only brought missfortune\". I don't know exactly what he meant by that. \n\nMy grandmother herself lived in a small city and their house was quite \"farmish\" (is this a word?). She wasn't affected by the war much, she only told us that one day a bom hit the church of their city, and she said it looked like a giant torch that slowly collapsed. Moreover one day the nuns from a nearby monastery were sent away (she does not know where and why) and that day her dad removed the picture of Hitler from the wall. \nBecause of their farmish house, they had enough food even during the famine after the war. \n\n\nMaybe someone enjoyed those (true) stories, if you got any questions, ask me :) ", "Im german, 21 years old. As you can imagine, the nazi period is quite an issue for our society. To answer your question: i feel like the regular soldiers are silently But deeply respected. No one talks about them, because you just dont dare to say ANYTHInG positive about this timeframe in germany in public. You will find a Lot of memorial structures for jews and other victims of the nazis, But very very little for german soldiers or civilian victims. i feel like there is a Lot of silent agreement about the veterans because its not possible to describe the mixture of Bad conciousness, own suffering, getting betrayed and \"we had no choice\"-feeling. To clarify: i am still talking about the regular soldiers.  \nAnother interesting point is how the \"german guilt\" is handled in our society. Our leaders and the media praise our guilt publicly, they apologize on a regular Base for what our grandfather-generation has been involved with, and they make us feel as if we are right now still responsible. Every german student gets a whole year of repressing \"guiltguiltandguilt\" education, so we are allways aware of what we have done. \nOn the other hand , my Generation begins to feel and even express something New Regarding our country: proud. Proud about our culture, our knowledge, our economy, our values.I truely hope that the Rest of us will realize that we are more than just Generation 3 After the Nazis. \n", "Neo-nazi bullshit.\n\nTo all non-German redditors that may not realize this: the above comment does *not* express mainstream German thought. (Well, maybe it is mainstream in the brown rural areas of the former GDR where the openly \"national democratic\" - cough - NPD is still getting votes, but not anywhere else.)\n\nGermans do not generally feel that they are being guilt-tripped into anything. Quite the opposite, actually: our parent's generation, the ['68ers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_student_movement), fought for a Germany in which the atrocities that were commited during the Nazi rule could be openly discussed. (Prior to that, talking about the Nazi rule was often seen as a taboo.) Of course we do get a lot of education on the issue in school and it can be annoying, but in my experience, most students acknowledge the necessity of this.\n\nThen the thing regarding the \"saying anything positive is forbidden\" (a trope which often comes up in German far-right-wing circles): this is not quite true. For example, it would not usually be frowned upon if you said \"in Hitler Germany, the state gave work to the unemployed through job creation plans, and we should do something similar today\". However, what definitely *is* being frowned upon are sentences like \"even today, we still drive on the highways that Hitler built\", because they (and actually, that sentence in particular) are a common fascist trope to divert attention away from the issues that actually matter about the things that Hitler built (like them mostly being created by slave labor, for one).\n\nNow regarding the pride issue: while it is not untrue that Germans do have some pride in their country, this pride is definitely not comparable to nationalist countries like the USA, and for most Germans is not stronger for the nation than it is for their hometown or their Bundesland.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and the \"but Germans suffered a lot during the war as well\" thing is *another* very telling far-right trope that often comes up when discussing history with fucktards. Of course Germans suffered a lot - because that's what happens when you first elect a government that kills people for no reason and then willingly go to war! You'll often hear fascists complain about the Germans that were exiled from Poland after the war, because it is, in light of a violation of human rights as barbaric as the holocaust, of course TOTES EVIL if the ~~Poles~~ Soviets shoo away the Germans which had oppressed and killed them for years.", "Great post, thank you!", "It's a shame that your comment hasn't nearly as many upvotes as the comment you referred to.

They treated their laborers well, unlike the farmers next door, and had to pretend they were abusing them because otherwise they would've been killed. At the end of the war when the Americans came, their laborers defended my great grandparents from the angry mob of freed laborers that went from farm to farm to kill their abusers. The farmers next door were already dangling from a tree.", "What comes around goes around. My grandfather and his jewish neighbors had been friends for several years before the war.

There are only two kinds: Villains (all nazis, such as the early SS members, a highly political unit) and Victims - such as the non-nazis within the Wehrmacht, and the many drafted soldiers. Plus of course the civilians.\n\nThis mindset mostly consists until today. Soldiers, like those who fight in Afganistan, are either simply doing their job (one that many dislike) or are victims of the circumstances. They may recieve empathy or antipathy, but no thanks.\n\nFrankly, Veteran celebrations like those in the USA freak many of us out. In our national experience, such militarism is an anachronism.

There is some appreciation for what they endured, a general feel of compassion for them. They fought in one of the most gruesome events in world history, endured more than most of us ever could imagine and only the toughest and most skilled soldiers survived at the front.

Came here to write that the Germans don't really have that kind of war hero or veteran thing. Firstly, you don't ever 'see' any. There is no holiday or event of any kind that would be about honoring them. So you would have to know someone personally who would be willing to tell about it himself. Considering the history of the country, that is a rather rare thing. \nSecondly, you should understand that the military personnel is in no way especially respected in Germany. You don't really care if you see one and rather find it amusing when they wear their uniform outside of their service station.

Even if every single soldier might not have agreed with the country's plans, they still killed so many people. They had to risk their lives for their loved ones, I know, and they deserve respect and love, but I still don't see a reason to thank any soldier. There should be no encouragement for murder in any case, IMO. War is a terrible thing, it is never justified to kill another person. Also, there were the death camps, and before that, the \"bullying\" (don't know a better word for it) of any Jewish people or minorities. Most of the country just standing by and watching something like the holocaust happen is just unbelievably heartless and inhuman to me.\n\n\nThis is only my opinion. I can't say \"all Germans think like this\". I was lucky to have had the chance to visit the concentration camp in Dachau and the US Holocaust Museum and go through World, European and German History classes in school to make my own experiences. \n\n\n\nTL;DR(sort of): I think no German would tell a WW2 veteran thank you for his service, though, and war is a very negative thing here. It's not like we avoid the topics of WW1 and WW2, but most of it has been discussed so many times before and it's just such a shameful part of the country's history.

She told me that they were not viewed in a negative manner by the majority of the people because they did what they were told to do. I have read reports of soldiers crying when ordered or giving the orders to begin killing Jews. Over time, the same soldiers that cried over or tried to avoid it, eventually had no problem doing it.

He was what he was, and besides that; He did not have any Nazi thoughts, and he even had a close Jewish friend before he died. He was 19 when the war started, and looked like the ideal \"Arian\" to the Nazis. Naturally he got drafter to the special forces. He also said that they really did not have a choice, it was either join, or get executed.\n\nLater in Sweden he became an inventor, and invented \"vändskär\", which I don't know the english word for.

He is very very conservative and very patriotic. He does not like foreigners even though he hardly ever met any as he lives in a village of 20 houses on the countryside and never leaves it.

My grandfather was a combat engineer for the 35th infantry division. He saw a lot of combat, the day after D-Day until the end of the war and tons of major battles in between. After everything he experienced and all the buddies he lost, even after getting wounded, he said he felt no resentment towards the average German soldier. He knew that they were simply conscripted and they were trying to survive. Exactly like him. Obviously if he knew that, he knew about the SS. He told me that he regretted nothing if the soldiers were SS because they felt strongly about the Nazi parties cause. Because of this I think he doesn't like to talk about his actual combat experience. He's told me of only once when he killed a German soldier. He threw a grenade into a building that was occupied by a German spotter. Afterwards he didn't want to check inside because he was afraid that he killed a conscript.\n\nSo hopefully some people will realize that most German soldiers in the war were just normal people who missed their families and wanted to get back to them. Most weren't crazed killers.", "WOAH WOAH WOAH REDDIT.\n\nI get it Nazis are bad. But the general lack of understanding of the situation in German during WWII is beyond inexcusable.

It was a weird time and a weird place. Many people had to go to Vietnam from America, remember? Remember the horrible shit American soldiers did under \"following orders\". My Austrian boyfriend's grandfather was forced to join (at the time he lived in what was then Germany but now poland). After the war, a young boy who was drafted and following orders to defend his homeland, he was treated like shit by the russians and forced to march (trail of tears style) to Austria. \n\nGermans don't talk about the war like we do. We for some reason find war heroic and we act like we did a great thing. We really didn't do much, Russia and the UK did a lot of work, but mostly Russia. Though Russia was pretty aggressive too.

Thanking people for killing other, often innocent, people in the name of \"freedom\" (wich is often a spaceholder for some capitalistic ideas)  seems a bit off for me. I think people should be thanked for, if they really served the people of their country, especially if they got harmed doing this. But when does war really do good for anyone?

Then why the fuck was he at Stalingrad? The SS Cavalry wasn't there! During Stalingrad, they were engaged in anti-partisan work behind the lines, and massacring Jews (seriously, they were of the most involved in those atrocities). He would have been far to the north of Stalingrad. In fact, **NO DIVISIONS OF THE WAFFEN-SS WERE INVOLVED IN STALINGRAD**.\n\nNow, if he has been at Stalingrad (Which, if you are correct about his branch of service and his unit, he wasn't) how was he somehow listed MIA in February, 1943, yet then somehow isn't noticed until 1945, when he shows up at the end of the war just walking home? No, that doesn't sound legit in the slightest.

Only &lt;10% survived the harsh prison camps until they were released in the 1950's. Even if his great grandfather was the among the very few who survived Stalingrad and returned to Germany, he wouldn't have been killed by SS troopers because he \"didn't die for Hitler\" because after the end of WW2, there was no active SS!

My Dad, well not your Dad, left Ma for another tramp because and some bullshit politics.\"\n\nM: \"You two should go to the living room! I'll bring out the scotch!\"\n\nAaaaaand there you have it, how I met my long lost sister. So basically, her Dad is some high level politician with too much pussy on his hands, he travels all over the world and marry other women for lust. I haven't met her stepmom and her dad.\n\nHappiest moment of 2013 for me, now I'm like a 3 year old that mimics everything my sister's doing.

How did your mom even recognize her?  Or did something else occur? Gave her to the father?  There are just too many unanswered questions on this one.  Source:  adopted person.", "Now will you believe everything mom says?", "I was adopted at birth to a distant relative. My biological mom's uncle more specifically. My bio-mom was only 16 for two weeks when she gave birth to me. (Note that I've since learned this information, and didn't know it during the story below)\n\nAnyway, my being adopted wasn't hidden from me throughout my life at all, I would tell it to classmates in 1st grade and they would call me a liar and such about it.\n\nAnyway, as long as I could remember I always wanted a little sister. I would find girls around 2-4 years younger than me and label them my little sister and take care of them and look out for them. I'd do it to family friends, 2nd cousins, anyone I felt the smallest bit of responsibility for.\n\nThis goes on for years. My sophomore year in High School I'm still doing it with a cute girl in 8th grade.\n\nAnyway, I come home from school one evening and I'm talking to my mom about it, and sort of laughing about how I've been doing this even since I was young, and blah blah blah. (I tried not to talk about it too much, because I'd learned in the past that my mom wanted another child, but they couldn't have children). Anyway, something I said about it, my Mom got this really weird look in her eye. I immediately noticed it and asked her what was up? She didn't want to say. It took me 3 hours to finally drag it out of her that my bio-mom had another child, 2 years after me, and it was a girl. My mom was torn up about it because she really wanted to adopt the little girl as well, but my Dad was really worried. At the time in the news there had been stories about biological parents coming back and claiming their kids from their adoptive parents. My Dad was always worried they would come back for me, and didn't want to potentially suffer twice as much pain.\n\nAnyway, so now I'm 15 years old and I've just learned I have a sister out there somewhere. I know where she was born, her first name, her eye color, and her birthday. Having absolutely no idea what to do, I turn to the Internet. I created my own chain email pleading with strangers to pass along this information as best they can and help me find my sister. (In retrospect, this was a terrible idea, as it was incredibly disrespectful to my sister's adoptive parents). Thankfully nothing ever really came of it.\n\nSince I didn't have any leads or anything to go off of, I just kind of gave up about 4 months later. I can remember I was home one night, about to go out with and the phone rang. A woman was on the other line asking for my mom by her full name. She didn't sound like a spam call or anything but she wouldn't really tell me who she was. I didn't think anything of it at the time, just passed the info along to my mom that someone had called looking for her, but didn't give me a name or number to call her back.\n\n3 weeks later, my mom answered the call this time. It was my sister's adoptive mother. My sister had recently learned about me and was looking for me, but seeing as I was already a few years old when they had her, they had much more information to go off of.\n\nSo my younger sister and I had been looking for each other around the same time after learning about each other around the same time.\n\nLong story short, we grew up very differently, but still have very similar personalities. The only regret I have is that due to geological restrictions, we aren't anywhere near as close as I'd like to be.", "That's super adorable that you would adopt other younger girls As your little sisters when you were young.

Ghana and my friends and I were wearing American Flags as capes.\n\nBefore the game started a woman asks if I could take her picture with her husband (seeing as we are both American). I do, and we start talking. She asks what university we go to, and coincidentally her daughter goes to the SAME university! Now, that would be a small world situation in of itself, seeing as only 5000 undergrads go to this school. However, she tells me who her daughter is and a lightbulb went off in my brain. Her daughter and my roommate were having sex on a regular basis. I had even woken up one night to, unfortunately, witness that take place. Even as I spoke with this woman, my roommate was back in the US of A having sex with her - in that very moment. How do I know? She sent a text of the picture to her daughter, and my roommate texted me \"Why are you and ____'s mom in a picture together?\"", "This crazy, hot lesbian contacted me on okcupid. She definitely sounded batshit crazy...so crazy, I couldn't ignore it even though she's incredibly hot. Had a list of which astrological signs are not allowed to contact her, had sexist and homophobic views even though she openly states she's a lesbian and was contacting me (bi woman here), mentioned her parents a bit too much, had an insane list of what her ideal partner should be, and put a disclaimer that said she would still be marrying an Indian man from the same marga even though she's a lesbian, etc. Basically a profile I would typically dismiss as a troll profile.\n\n...only I recognized her from her photos, and when she messaged me, she signed off with her real first name and mentioned several relatively private information that confirmed her identity. I obscure my face in most of my photos so I guess she didn't recognize me initially.\n\nI had to reply with, \"Hi, this is awkward but we met before. We just had a business meeting today.\"\n\nShe didn't reply and blocked me.\n\nFunny thing was, we thought we were meeting for the first time in that meeting, but she looked really familiar.

While waiting outside the elevator going down, I noticed a group of really cute guys coming out of the door exactly opposite from our office. One of my new office mates mentioned in passing that these were the \"Cable Guys\", meaning they worked for that TV channel side of the company, mostly engineers. The whole group went in the elevator and some awkward giggling ensued. I kinda zeroed in on this one guy, clean shaven head, dressed in all black, yep my type. But I didn't think much about it since aside from being in one elevator ride down, I was sure there would be little interaction from both groups.\n\nFast forward to that same evening, I clicked on my 3 day old OkCupid account. Being new to OkCupid and as a transwoman I knew I wouldn't get anything right off the bat. But I got a message from a guy in a black cap, shirt and shades; \"How 90% of a match are we?\" I clicked on his profile and found out we shared a lot of interests. I answered that it is surprisingly accurate.\n\nThat led to small talk and questions about where we work. Long story short, yep, he was the guy I saw on the elevator.

A classmate of mine was from a very small farming town and high school with graduating classes of less than 75. Another classmate of ours over there was also from this same high school, he just went to a different University. This was completely unplanned and they did not find out until we all arrived in England. I later find out that a close friend of mine from back at school was also from this high school. For those keeping count at home, we are up to three guys from the same small town all connected at this small college in England. Now this is where it gets weird:\nMyself and three buddies are heading to Edinburgh for the weekend when another guy decides to tag along. Our hostel room is booked so he has to get a room separate from us. Opting for the cheapest option, he books a bed in a 12 person co-ed room which happened to be occupied by himself, 2 French men, and 9 American girls who were studying in London and were just in Scotland for the weekend. The first night he is awoken to one of the girls shaking violently, crying, and vomming all over her bed. A nice conversation starter the next morning at breakfast, we all end up hitting it off and decide to meet at a pub later that night. As we are talking, we learn that one of the girls is not only from this same small town, but is best friends with one of the guy's sisters. All of this, again, was unknown until this random chance meeting halfway across the world.\nTL;DR Traveled abroad, randomly connected to four different people from the same small high school.\n"]["A trained hostage negotiator", "With lots of experience.
