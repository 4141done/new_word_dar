["Not a very spectacular story but true.  I've always felt some encounter stories were real, but what made me truly believe was one night standing outside watching the stars.  It was late, maybe 2 a.m., and out in the country so it was dark, no street lights, very little to no moon.  I was watching what I thought was a satellite moving across the sky from right to left.  Didn't think twice about it as I saw them all the time.  Suddenly, the \"satellite\" stopped and shot off FAST, totally disappeared, at a 45-degree angle from the direction it came.  I have never ever seen a satellite change direction ever.  It startled me so much I stood there for a bit wondering if I really saw it or not, but I did, 100% certain.  It's unfortunate no one was there with me that night.\n\nEdit: Bad spelling :)", "Saw that same thing as a young kid. Did a lot of research to figure out what I saw. I noticed on mine it kind of flashed before the sudden direction change and then faded out afterwards. Long story short, we probably saw incoming meteorites with very steep angles of attack. Hitting the atmosphere at high velocities and at a steep angle caused them to \"skip\" back out into space. Sure I can find you more info on this but you can use google just like me.  \nEdit: Even if they don't skip back out into space and continue to burn up in the atmosphere the sudden deceleration can still cause direction shift. Think of throwing rocks into the water, they don't continue on the same trajectory they had before hitting the surface. ", "Very interesting. I saw this too. Probably 1990. My dad and I both saw it. We saw what looked to be a rocket launch of sorts. Slow moving and coming from what seemed to be the ground, but very far away. All of a sudden the thing shoots off at a very high rate of speed. We were both flabbergasted. As a skeptic, I've always held out for a plausible alternative to 'UFO'. This really fits the bill. Thanks for that.", "Kicked back on a rooftop one clear summer night in Germany, looking up at the stars. I spot a satellite up there and watch it traverse the night sky as they usually do. It just looked like a regular little old white dot in the sky, no different from a star except it moved in a constant direction at a constant speed, as satellites tend look to the naked eye from the ground.\n\nSuddenly, when it was pretty much directly overhead, this thing turns on a dime and moves in a completely different direction, then again, and again, tracing a perfect isosceles triangle pattern... when it moved back to the point it had initially changed heading from, it up'n'fucking hauls ass at a much higher speed and a slightly different heading than when I first spotted it, until it dips below the horizon.\n\nAt first I thought it was a surveillance satellite or a weather satellite or whatnot, told a friend of mine who'd been in Army Intelligence and knows about stuff like this. He told me satellites can't maneuver like that. Claimed I'd seen a bona fide UFO.\n\nEdit: This was about 1995 or 96\n\nEdit2: I like your meteorite theory, but why would a meteorite move in a perfect isosceles triangle pattern?\n", "You have no idea how happy I am that I landed on your explanation. My friends and I saw this exact thing happen a couple years ago, and we couldn't find any logical explanation to what had happened. THANK YOU!!", "I've seen one of these too! As much as I wanted to believe that it was a UFO, your answer seems much more plausible. The 12 year-old me would've been really disappointed had I known then.", "This actually blows my mind because I've seen something with the EXACT description you just gave.  I wasn't going to post, but I'll go ahead and tell my story:\n\nOne night around 1999, I was hanging out with some friends.  We were just talking, hanging out, all around not doing much.  I noticed a light traveling across the sky and decided to follow it idly while I hung out.  It was a solid, white light and the intensity and speed of it gave me the impression of a semi-low flying airplane.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  It went behind a tree, and I lost track of it so I decided to watch for it on the other side.  After a few seconds I looked up again to find it and I saw it shoot off at about a 30 degree angle back the way it came (i.e. it made a &gt; sign).  The speed matched that of a falling star.  In fact, if I didn't see the slow light before I would have just assumed I just saw a bright, long falling star. ", "My sister says to have seen the same exact thing. Strange.", "Someone posted a similar experience in another thread. As it turns out, Meteors can come into the atmosphere seeming like they're coming right for you, but then bounce off and continue into space, and if the geometry works out just right, from certain exact points of view, it will seem like it made an aggressive, sometimes up to 90 degree turn.", "An interesting thing is the Hubble space telescope had a unencrypted live camera feed and on the news they showed footage of space objects in orbit around the earth doing exactly what you witnessed. NASA said they were meteorites but meteorites never behave like that unless other objects strike them. The sudden accelerations and rapid change of direction they made would have obliterated them had they been struck by anything at those velocities. They then put military level encryption on the camera feed just after the news stories. Coincidence?...", "I occasionally suffer from sleep paralysis. It developed in my early twenties, and I've had the alien abduction dream. My dad and I loved to watch shows about aliens, so I assume people who claim they were abducted had some form of sleep paralysis.\n\nIt started with flashes of blue light, and I felt myself being lifted out of bed by the chest. I was blinded by a white light, and I could hear a loud mechanical whirring. When I woke up, I was sitting up in bed with my chest stuck out. My arms were holding me up. The experience was the most intense sleep paralysis dream I've ever had. I can see how someone else could have that dream, panic, and tell everyone about it. ", "Any paranormal/alien experience that begins with the person in bed, pretty much discountable. Sleep paralysis is absolutely terrifying, without any dreams seeping into reality.\n\nNot to say that legitimate things don't happen, but these ain't it. ", "I sometimes have it without the dreams. I'll be semi-aware, but I can't move. Every time I think I'm dying, constantly trying to call for help, but I just can't. My mouth won't work, my body won't move, I'm just trapped in my thoughts. \nThen I'll suddenly just regain control like nothing was happening. Doesn't happen often, but it's awful. ", "I've never had sleep paralysis before but just the thought terrifies me. I can't sleep on my back facing up in fear that I'll experience it", "It's funny, I sort of set myself up for it. I refuse to sleep on my stomach. Whenever I try, I get the overwhelming feeling that someone is sneaking up on me and I panic and flip over. ", "As someone who has slept almost exclusively on their stomach their entire life, that sounds miserable.", "I've had it maybe 5 times in my life. (i'm 20) The first time was absolutely terrifying. I was probably 14 at the time and I remember trying to yell for my parents and not being able to. The second time I remember hearing a loud noise and seeing some yellow light and thinking that I was dead. I was weirdly at peace with it. The 3rd-4th-5th (or maybe more or less, I don't know) are more \" *goes to move arm* , *arm doesn't move* \" \"God damnit body, wake up\" *waits 5 seconds and \"wakes up\"*. \n\nThankfully all my episodes have been &lt;10 seconds. I've never had any major hallucinations thank god, just a feeling of paralysis. \n\nEverytime it happens though its the same thing. It happens where i've already woken up but i'm being lazy and not getting up so i'm drifting in and out of sleep. So when I go to move thinking i'm awake my body disagrees for a few seconds. ", "Okay, I've had sleep paralysis several times now, likely do to the ADD medications I've taken since childhood (I'm 28), as well as the fact that as a hardcore gamer, my sleep schedule was constantly ass backwards. Frankly I'm an ideal candidate (or at least I have been over the years) for sleep paralysis. After the first or second time it's no big deal to me but that's because I do something that most people probably don't think to do when they find themselves paralyzed. I DO NOTHING. The absolute worst thing you guys can do is freak and and try to move, at all. All that does is intensifies the awkwardness of being unable to control your body. If you realize you are paralyzed, seriously, just lay there and relax for 30-60 seconds, think of it as 60 seconds of bonus sleep time, that's how long they last typically. \n\nJust lie there, shrug it off as best you can, don't try moving, at all, and it's no big deal, seriously. I think I've actually woken up paralyzed, realized what it was, stayed motionless and literally fell back asleep without moving positions. I'm not implying you guys should be able to do that, but it's entirely within your power to not be crippled by the fear of it happening, and not freaking out when it does.\n\nSleep well!", "I've never had it with dreams.  Since I was a kid, this has happened to me probably once a month.  I've only recently begun to handle it well during the paralysis itself.  The big thing for me is realizing what is happening (I'm experiencing sleep paralysis.  I will be ok soon.), then trying to relax.  I try to just empty my mind and slip back into sleep.  I still freak out on occasion, but I find that trying to force myself to move/wake up just makes it worse.", "Holy fuck youre just like me. I swear I'm awake when it happens, and I know exactly what's happening - I just can't do *anything* about it. I tell myself to breathe as calmly as I can (although I can barely breath whatsoever), and after 10 seconds or so I just gasp and take in air and I'm okay.\n\nDo you get it when if you try to fall back to sleep straight away, it happens again? It happens to me until I move (roll over) or something. Its really weird because once its over, I can almost *feel* the paralysis taking back over and it takes a lot of effort for me to overcome it and actually move myself to stop it from happening again.", "Damn, you're exactly right. Basically it only happens to me during naps, or close to when I'd actually get out of bed. If I try to go back to sleep it'll happen again, so I usually just say fuck it and get out of bed.

All of my friends were up there with me, and we were all laughing and shitting around. I looked out over the dark water and dark sky, and suddenly this enormous invisible thing started moving across the sky. I could tell it was moving because all the stars and light were getting displaced by its form. It wasn't just a static thing either, it had this motion of flapping. This was before I had seen any movies that used invisibility cg effects, but you know how in predator they cg him so that you can slightly see him raised above the background? That's what this looked like.\n\nIt really freaked me out, because this was at a far distance, and it was still large. The duration was long enough that I could gape at it before it disappeared. I turned to my friends and said OMG GUYS DID YOU SEE THAT and everyone ignored me lol. I'm not sure if it was an alien thing or a trick of the...light? I have no idea. \n\ntldr: organic looking alien things. ", "Thats crazy. I hope its true. I saw something but not like that", "\"I saw something, but not like that.\" \n\n...me too?", "I also saw something that was nothing like that. The plot thickens.", "I am seeing something not like that at this very moment. ", "OH GOD IT'S IN MY HOUSE!", "IT'S ON MY BODY; IT'S WRAPPED AROUND ME HEEELLLP", "*sigh*\n\nAnd what was that, turdferguson?", "A GIANT SHIT", "If only someone with the knowledge can explain what this was.", "I can't say for sure what happened to me that night, but here is what I know...\n\nI was driving home for the weekend from school at Indiana University.  It takes me about two hours to get home, and I left Bloomington around 10:00pm.  At exactly 10:53 I am on a rural stretch of the two  lane highway I take home, and I notice what appeared to be flashing lights behind me.  I thought, \"great, I'm getting pulled over,\" so I turned onto the next country road about a quarter mile from where I noticed the lights.  As the car came to a stop and I started to open my glove box to get out my registration and proof of insurance, the lights suddenly disappeared, and no car drove past.  \n\nNow here is where the story takes a turn for the weird, and I am sure you guys will think I'm just making it all up because it really does seem like something straight out of a typical UFO movie or story.  The electronics in my car started to go haywire.  The radio was randomly changing stations while the volume kept going up and down while the dome light and headlights start to flicker and turn off and back on.  This was at 10:56 pm.  I start thinking to myself that my battery must be failing, or else I have a short somewhere in the electric system of my car... so I lean down to pop the hood so I can take a look at the battery, and that is the last thing I remember doing.  The next thing I know, I open my eyes and see nothing but the night sky full of bright stars - it was a cold night and it seemed like I had never seen stars that bright in my life.  I sat up and looked around, and I saw absolutely nothing. Nothing at all.  I was in the middle of a field, surrounded by corn stalks left over from the recent harvest.  As I started to come to my senses I started to freak out.  Where am I? Why the fuck am I asleep in the middle of a field? Where the fuck is my car?  I got up and started walking toward the distant headlights I could see from a road about half a mile away.  \n\nWhen I got to the nearest intersection I looked at the signs which read  350N and 50W.  I was half a mile away from my car which was just right off the main road.  I started walking toward the headlights I could see on the main road.  I can't say how long it took me to walk the half mile but it couldn't have been more than 10 or 15 minutes.  When I arrived at my car all the lights were out - my battery had died, which struck me as odd because I couldn't have been gone for that long.  I looked at my phone which was sitting on the passenger seat, and the time was 2:17 AM.  Over three hours had passed since I turned off onto the side road for the flashing lights behind me.  I remember sitting in my car completely dumbfounded, wondering what the hell had just happened to me.  After about half an hour of just sitting there I remembered that my battery was dead; so I got on the phone and called AAA to come out and give me a jump.  It took about an hour for them to get out to me since I was a good distance away from the nearest town; during which time I just sat in silence, running through the possible scenarios in my head concerning what had just happened.  To this day I couldn't tell you what really happened to me that night.  All I know is I can't think of any plausible explanation as to why I woke up over half a mile away from my car in the middle of a corn field more than three hours after I had stopped.  I have only shared this story with one other person - my uncle.  I am sure people would either look at me like I'm crazy or they would call bullshit on the whole story.  And I can't blame them... if somebody came to me with a story like that, that so closely mirrors the stereotypical encounter story, I probably wouldn't believe them either.\n\n**EDIT:** corrected conflicting tenses.", "Holy dicks. That's scary as fuck.", "I can't account for why you were in a field, but Bloomington Indiana is literally right on the border of the eastern and central time zone line. Quite literally. The fact that you were looking at the time on your phone makes me a bit skeptical because it is possible that you lost an hour due to cell phone towers changing time zones. I know you say you lost 3 hours, but could you have possibly unitentionally exaggerated the story after it happened? The fact that you were waiting in the car for 30 minutes after the event, and then you waited another hour for a jump start - this would account for 2 and a half hours (with the cell phone tower time change). Maybe you actually looked at your phone as you drove away and though you had a missing time gap of 3 hours? Being a magician, I know how the brain can generate false memories after the fact. I have people come up to me swearing that I did a trick to them that I never did. They can see it in their minds eye. The brain is a funny thing.", "This is nuts! ", "Holy shit, that's terrifying!", "Any physical effects later? Have you considered hypnosis?", "my eyes are watering so hard.", "Ok, here it goes. The first time I had ever seen anything I was 7 in Houston, Texas. I used to like to climb on top of my mom's suburban in the driveway and stare at the stars. One night I saw an intensely bright floating light over the treeline probably about a half mile away. I hollered but nobody came to see it. I did not see anything else until March of 2008. \n\nThis experience happened between the 10th and the 15th, but I can't give a specific date because I was up for 4 days trying to come up with some explanation to satisfy what I had seen. This was in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. My mother lived in a garden home community, all houses the same size, all one story, and you had great visibility distance wise. \n\nI walked out of my buddy's place at exactly 4 AM to a bright starry night. When I walked out something caught my eye to the left of me. I looked over and saw a bright blue, yellow, green, white, red, orange strobing flashing light floating silently to the left. I stood in awe at it and did not want to go grab anyone because I didn't want to miss anything. I watched as it passed in front of the moon behind my friend's place and I saw the outline of the craft. It was a teardrop, sunflower seed type shape, and the craft seemed to have the lights being transmitted from the top half of it. It was almost as if it was transmitting some type of light pattern upward. It also had a dark, thin, smooth line of exhaust that disappeared 50-75 feet behind it. This all occurred no less than 400 yards away from me. After it passed the moon I ran inside and grabbed someone. He saw it but it was too far away to make out what it was. \n\nI went home which was only a few blocks away and looked out from the driveway the same direction the first craft had come from. I saw two dim white lights slowly coming over the horizon at a slow pace heading towards me. I then ran inside and grabbed my mother out of bed. We stood there for about 20 minutes while 5 separate crafts flew over us, first came two, then two, then one, about 6-7 minutes apart from each other, maybe 20 mph, maybe 200 feet up, completely silent. The way that they looked from underneath was each one had two huge bright white lights which were maybe 30-40 feet across each but they were so bright it was hard to get a good estimate.  They also had a pulsating red one between the white lights that dimmed and re-lit. I would estimate from the size of the white lights that each craft was maybe between 150-200 feet wide.  \nThe last craft that flew over us flew over lower and slower than the first four had. Then, it made a noise. It let out a sound that to this day haunts me. What I could best compare it to would be this sound http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxzArT3bH0Y[1] followed immediately after by this sound http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpDxgmCofnU[2] . That's the best I could find. Take those two sounds, except make it digital, and multiply it by 50, this...was...loud. The craft did that twice. These crafts flew directly over us and I believe that the sound was an acknowledgement. Whatever was piloting it knew we were watching it, kind of like a hello. I immediately started crying, I had no idea what I was looking at or had just heard. \n\nThe second big experience I had occurred a couple weeks later. I was standing in my driveway smoking a cigarette listening to my ipod somewhere around 2 AM. I decided to pause my ipod to turn on the back light, waved my hand over it a couple times making somewhat of a strobe pattern. I didn't hear anything, I didn't see anything come up, but I got that being watched feeling. I looked up, and directly above me was a trapezoid shaped craft with rounded edges that had a dark red and black pulsating glowing outline. It was like flowing electricity. It was not even 75 feet up, I could have hit this thing with a rock. I stood there while it hovered directly above me completely silent for maybe 10-15 seconds while it made this kind of motion similar to the ball that Luke trained with in Star Wars. It hovered side to side, front to back in a smooth motion, never getting more than 20 feet away from its original position. It was extremely fascinating, but I was frozen stiff. After those few seconds, I waved one hand at it in a friendly manner, it then changed light pattern and hovered away behind my house. Upon deeper inspection, the fact that it knew that I saw it but made no effort to evade my detection makes me think it wanted me to follow it, although I was too freaked out to think about that at the time. \n\nI have seen that same craft on 3 other different occasions, once again in Tuscaloosa, once in Hoover, and once in Bessemer. The time I saw it in Hoover was at an apartment complex at the top of a huge hill with a great overlook. It was night time and I was with friends. Over the overlook, I saw a grey craft facing my direction that looked similar to a Hoth fighter(forgive the star wars references), and as soon as I saw it, it took off to the right silently extremely quick. The times in Bessemer and Tuscaloosa the trapezoid shape appeared in the sky solid white, stretched to twice its length, then the bottom shot up to the front, like it hit light speed or something. \n\n\nI do frequently see what I like to call streaks. They look like shooting stars only very low, move slower, but they still have tails that stream behind them. They can also appear in many different colors. \nOne strange story is one night when I had a dream in Tuscaloosa. In the dream, I couldn't see or hear anything, but I could feel things. I was laying on something cold, and I felt what seemed like rubber between my legs around my junk. It was very strange to me since a lot of people who report abductions report sperm and eggs being taken for breeding programs. The next morning, I went to let the dog out in the backyard, which is very small. To the left of the patio, there was a solid white ring in the grass that was maybe 8-10 feet wide. I showed my mother and she had told me that she heard a noise that woke her up the night before, but she just dismissed it. \n\nAnother extremely confusing experience I had occurred in my driveway in Tuscaloosa. To give you an idea of where this occurred, look up Shelton State Community College. The house was less than a quarter mile from the campus in the Englewood neighborhood. It was night time and I heard this static that I could compare to a jet, I looked over and directly above the community college was a light blue slit in the sky. I would say it was maybe two hundred yards long, completely vertical, and had what looked like white electric currents coming off of both sides of it. I looked at it and maybe about 25 white things shot out of the slit to the left one at a time at a quick pace leaving the trail behind it that I previously talked about. After they passed, the bottom of the slit went upward until the slit closed, and it made a strange sound, and then it was gone. \n\nI've also had a bunch of experiences with orbs. Some solid lit that float across the sky or move in strange patterns, and some that brighten up to a great intensity and then fade as they pass. After that first big experience I started doing some research because I was so confused. I understand that I've had an abnormally large amount of experiences, and I honestly can't tell you why, I wish I could.\n\n  I found a type of UFO witness called a contactee. These people are similar to abductees except they are kept up with. I have no idea why I have had so many experiences, and I have only listed a fraction of them. My best guess would be that since I acknowledged the presence of whatever it was I was seeing, it decided to keep up with me. It's kind of a gift and a curse. There are so few people that I can talk with about it and be taken seriously. I want to seek hypnotherapy to see if there might be anything else I could uncover. I'm grateful but still don't know much about my experiences. If y'all can get anything out of what I shared then great. If you have any questions I'll be glad to answer them. \n\nEdit: Formatting", "This is insane. How old are you now?", "I'm 25", "Have you ever talked about your experiences with a doctor? ", "Agreed.\n\nI say this with complete and total respect for the possibility that you may be seeing real things, hifempty69.  But the probability of seeing that many UFOs is, frankly, low, based on everything ever reported about these being more or less one-time occurrences.\n\nHave you considered that this may be schizophrenia?  I know that's a nasty question, but if you could get some help early, it might make a big difference for you if you turned out to have that terrible condition.  I really mean this as compassionately as I possibly can and I am not making fun of you.", "Seriously, he should contact a doctor. This sounds like it could be a neurological issue.", "Or for not carrying around a camera after the first few experiences, I feel like by now he would at least try to document the things he saw. ", "&gt;psychological\n\nFTFY", "he said momsie seen them to tho", "really interesting stories, thank you! i would be happy to read any more you might have. :3", "I don't even know where to start.  Maybe the most enlightening experience I had was this.  I used to talk about these things that were happening to anyone who was willing to listen.  I've become a little more reserved from being hurt a few times opening up.  It seemed to me like the more I would try to inform people about what happened, the more experiences there would be.  There was this guy named Adam that I was hanging out with for a while.  I took him home from a friend's apartment one night at around 3-4 AM, which was normal for that time period since I was sleeping until 4 in the afternoon.  I had been trying to talk to people about this stuff non-stop, and when I took him to his house, we chilled and smoked in the driveway for a minute.  All of a sudden, an intensely bright light appeared over the hill that was less than a mile from his house and we were both immediately drawn to it.  I started looking around seeing if there was anything else happening, and I looked up.  Above us were two orbs pivoting around and I drew his attention to them.  I told him that I felt like they showed us that bright light to try and gauge our responses, and we just looked up and waved at the orbs.  Then, all of a sudden, the sky came to life.  There must have been 3 dozen orbs flying around in every which direction and over the horizon streaks started taking off.  It was definitely a spiritual experience.\n\nI have a couple more experiences with orbs.  I was on a friend's back porch who lived near me and he and I were both very interested in the topic.  We were sitting there chatting and this bright light, maybe a couple hundred yards away starts drifting across the sky very slowly, very low, and silent.  As it drifted, it brightened in intensity to the point we couldn't look directly at it.  It was an orange light in color.  It stayed lit a couple of seconds and then slowly faded out, and we just looked at each other in awe.  That happened there a couple more times, once upon request.  Naturally, people made fun of me for claiming that these things happened to me.  We were trying to explain to a couple of friends what happened when we saw the orb and they didn't believe us, so I said \"You wanna see a UFO?  Come over here\", no idea why, I was just feeling cocky.  We get to the back porch where the first experience happened and sure enough, that light brightened up again and did the same thing.  I've only had people with me for a few experiences.  \n\nI've developed my own thoughts about what has happened to me, its origins, and why me.  After my first big experience happened with the 5 crafts, I jumped online and started doing research.  I feel almost as if I was led to this.  I found this thing called the Raelian belief, or intelligent design.  It basically states that ETs seeded human life on earth through genetic manipulation, and we will eventually become so advanced that we'll seed life on other planets.  It is very closely aligned with the ancient astronaut theory in stating that ETs have played a role in the development of human civilization in multiple ways.  The way the Raelian belief started is from this dude Rael, who claims he saw a UFO land in a dormant volcano in the 70s.  He says he approached the craft and out came a small humanoid like ET that educated him about how all of our religions were wrong and stemmed from ancient ET misinterpretation.  When I looked at it closer, when you think of instances like Ezekiel being lifted into the heavens, chariots of fire in the sky, or the light that guided Moses through the desert, it's not difficult to attribute it to ETs.  The interesting thing was that the ET told him that every major prophet of every religion was manipulated by ETs via thought implantation to instill spiritual beliefs that compelled them to share their beliefs and spirituality with others.  Not saying that I believe any of this, but the more that I spread the word about my experiences, the more they seemed to happen.  I can probably write a book about all this stuff lol.", "You should write a blog or something, at least. I'd read it. Post your old stories and anything new happening. I'm not much of a UFO person, and I have no evidence to prove any story I've ever read is real, but I don't have a problem with the idea of ETs or UFOs, I suppose, so I'm always interested in reading more.

A second show gave a relatively unbiased account of more historical UFO encounters. Obviously some of this stuff was blown out of proportion, but it was still pretty interesting. Ever since then I still think UFO's and some sort of life form from the universe earth is checking us out. For having such a connection to these things... That's awesome.", "Wow, this stuff is interesting and scary at the same time.", "Any way you would be willing to have people spend time around you to see what happens. Like some kind of research team or something. ", "There's a documentary called Chariots of the Gods.  It's from 1970 and is a bit dated in its filmography, and... well.. kind of everything.

Any time I've had a camera and tried to capture anything, nothing happens.  I honestly believe that they do not want to be documented, but rather experienced.  I feel that their aim is spirituality and heightened consciousness.  I try to think of them as similar to nature videographers and photographers.  They are not allowed to interfere with the environment they are observing but allow themselves to be seen, and are willing to interact as long as it doesn't interfere with the balance of nature.  Such as changing the belief of someone who doesn't, they would disclose themselves to those who they detect an honest desire to learn and experience from.  That's my take on it any way.

I could feel it very near the surface and poked a hole in my ear with a sterilized needle. Blood, fucking everywhere, I could feel this thing and I squeezed up, towards the hole I just pierced. Out pops this tiny metal... ball. Maybe half the size of a BB. It was black metal, with an indentation around the center, and teeny tiny golf ball-like indentations. \n\nAs I was rolling it around in my blood-covered pictures, it slipped, spun around the sink a couple of times and fell down the drain.

I've had cystic acne before but never on my leg and not in a long time, but it felt so damn hard. \n\nThis drove me crazy for a day or two until I finally did the extraction.

I was watching a movie on Primestar, can't remember the name, but it had just started. I was sitting up in bed, back against the wall, and the next thing I know the screens black. I press the menu button, thinking I must've accidentally changed the channel, but its still the same. The movie that was on was more than half way through and the reason it was black was my mother had put an R rated movie restriction on the box. Basically I went from watching a movie to two hours missing and an entirely new movie starting. I also had three marks on my forearm in the shape of a triangle. They went away after a few weeks, but the growth in my nose is still there.\n\n That house was weird  though, our first night in the house my sister and I slept in the same room. We're laying there trying to fall asleep and I hear someone whistling. I tell my sister to knock it off and she immediately tells me to shut up and stop messing around. The whistling keeps getting louder until it sounds like its in the room with us. Again I tell her to stop and she responds the same way. I tell her its not me, she turns over  on her bed so she's facing me and we're both staring at each other, mouths closed, and the whistling is still going. We scream for our mom and her boyfriend. As soon as the door opens the whistling stops. We explain what happened, they look at us funny and leave. Not more than 10 seconds later the whistling starts again. We scream for them to come back, the door opens,  the whistling stops. This time her bf takes off outside and cases the house. No ones outside, dogs aren't even barking.  He says he can't find anything and they leave again. The whistling comes back. We're done. We refused to sleep in that room and sleep in the living room until we moved.

As we are driving along this fairly deserted back road I began to zone out and I stare at this blinking red light off in the distance and casually think to myself \"I wonder when they built a cell phone tower all the way out here. \" When suddenly it blinks and is dramatically closer than it was just a moment earlier, at this point my friend points it out and stops in the road. It blinks once more and is directly in front and over top of us, the red light is so bright it floods the car in a deep scarlet hue. I lean forward so that I can see directly into the light, in that brief moment I feel a flood of negative emotions the closest description I can offer is to that of being naked under a giant microscope and having every pore examined thoroughly. I then look away from the light to my friend and ask him to drive, he barely responds apparently in a similar state. Then he snaps out of it and starts driving, as we get a little ways down the road I notice the red light isn't fading and the interior of the car is still clearly lit by it. I look out the window and to my horror the light is following us and does so for approximately 1-2 miles. The light unexpectedly veers off to the left and comes down to ground level in a patch of trees adjacent to the road. My friend stops the car again and continues to stare at it and abruptly declares he is going to get out and look it like he is in some sort of trance. He opens the door and I grab his arm and tell him if he does I will get in the driver seat and leave him, that we had to leave that instant.

I couldnt move and I was bare chested and was having difficulty breathing, I still couldnt smell hear or feel anything. Next to the tables is the soccer and football field and there in the middle of the field I could see the craft had stopped spinning and was somehow grounded and not making any movement or emitting any lights anymore. \nImmediately after that I was surrounded by, I kid you not what everyone recognizes as \"grey\" aliens... They were so tall and horrifying I tired and tried to scream but nothing would come out I was paralyzed with fear but I could sense my screams inside my chest, I have never been so frightened in my life, All I recall was them surrounding me and just starring into my eyes, Those diagonal black slits that were so used to seeing. \nThey all had a different colored uniforms that were made out of some crazy reflective material that I have never seen before. Thats all I remember about that night, I then closed my eyes and found myself standing in the exact place where I first witnessed the red white and blue lights. I began to cry and just went to sleep and never told a soul about that night.\n\n\nafter reading some posts on here I too feel a lump on my left earlobe right where people usually get a piercing, I feel like digging it out and seeing if it could too be a little metal BB.

", "well this is an interesting story I guess. Maybe some of you will enjoy it (although I am going to try to summarize).\nFor three nights, strange things happened. The first night I was reading, and I remember a peculiar sensation wrapping around the top of my head and travelling down my neck. I never had anything like this occur to me -- it was like a static massage, and I took note. It almost scared me. I soon went to bed, yet was awoken in the middle of the night at some point. I was on my back, and looking at my window. I remember I was hallucinating extremely bad, the window was morphing and innumerable colors were present. I remember thinking at this time two things. First, I was absolutely awake. Second, although delirious, I recalled that these hallucinations were normal, and I was glad to be greeted by them, because they happen every night. When I woke up the next morning, I had a startling realization that I don't actually hallucinate every night -- and couldn't wrap my head around the fact that it seemed so normal at the time.\n\nThe second night, the exact same thing happens. Strange sensation on my head, I go to sleep, I awake tripping. This time I am on my stomach looking towards the lights of my computer tower on the floor. There were symbols emanating from the colors of those blue and orange lights, and I was visibly tripping. Again, I was comforted by the thought that this was normal, and awoke to consider how peculiar it was to think it was. \n\nThe third night I will never forget. It changed my fucking life. I remember waking up to an extremely vivid image of three beings hovering in front of me, Their skin was grey, heads large, and bodies much taller than the normal stature of a human. There was rocky earth beneath us, lit quite well possibly by an extremely starry sky above me yet no other visible light source. This image flashed in front of my eyes for a split second, and then I was looking at the blackness of my closed eyelids. I then became aware of the most incredible sensation I have ever felt. Although I could feel myself localized within my body, there was an expanse. Words will never do this justice, as I fear it was too much a subjective experience; in my description, I can only describe it with an introverted intuition. The best analogy I can make, is with attaining nirvana in a Buddhist sense. I felt connected with everything in the world, and have never had such strange experiences (to my knowledge) since. \n\nI became compelled to understand what happened to me. I am an academic, so my research brought me to areas wherein one hemisphere of my brain screamed 'pseudoscience!!' at the other more open and inquisitive side. The truce of my hemispheres of thought almost became relegated to the single truth I could agree fully upon: I know nothing, and therefore, anything is possible.\n\nOver a few years, I found answers that have made me content at night, yet unfortunately bat-shit crazy to anyone I would consider talking to this about.  I began researching past life regressions (no, everyone was not abe lincoln or cleopatra in their last lives), channeling, abductions, trance meditation, and astral projection. First, I found that through one channeled experiment, a researcher (If you will call her that) asked a supposed entity what it was like in a higher 'dimension', and it was replied that it was like a shamanic experience. Like you were TRIPPING. Second, through another book on channeling, an extremely advanced race was contacted, and they were asked how they contact individuals on Earth. It was suggested that not all abductions are physical encounters, and not all abductions (or otherwise) are bad. I now consider my experience took place in a dream state, and that it was a damn good experience. Apparently, this group of extra-terrestrials, if I am to consider the validity of this text, contacts individuals to guide their purpose in life, as they are - not originally - of earth origin. Well fuck. That makes sense to me I suppose. I know something extreme happened to me those three nights. I am reminded of the movie Contact with Jodie Foster, and I wonder when the scientific actualization of our race will further fuck with our paradigms. Maybe that movie will become classic science fact.", "I still have no idea what [this was](http://i.imgur.com/rf68Umz.jpg).\n\n\nI was out in the cornfields south of Des Moines trying to get a photo of the Milky Way.  This red thing flew from South to North - not a sound at all.  It flickered as it moved and was much slower than any meteor I've ever seen.  I was able to swing my camera around to take this 20-second exposure.", "You should have put the Serious tag on, OP.", "ITT: Lots of government stealth planes.", "now, before i tell my odd story i should start by saying, i do not believe in aliens, at least aliens that could make contact with human civilization given the vast size of the universe, the conditions required for a planet to sustain life, and the fact that these aliens would have to be alive during the same time frame that we exist. Which, from what i've gathered, is near impossible. Not completely, but near. Anywho... August of 2012, if memory serves me correctly, i was visiting a friend of mine to watch a meteor shower on top of her roof in Detroit, Michigan. She was a student at Wayne University and had a studio apartment with access to the tall old building's roof. There was a group of about seven of us that went up to the roof after smoking some tetrahydrocannabinol to enjoy watching the meteor shower. Unfortunately, this night happened to be very cloudy. There was only slight sliver's of the actual night sky hiding behind the clouds in a deep purple illuminated by the moon (well technically the sun's light bouncing off the moon but screw you for bringing science into this). Cutting to the point, i noticed a light cutting through the clouds, and i thought \"whoa! a meteor!\" but then suddenly the light turned on a perfect 90 degree angle and cut through the clouds like a bullet through marshmallows and disappeared before I ever got a chance to utter the word \"look!\" Nobody saw the phenomenon but me and i was high. Weed has been known to give hallucinogenic effects in large doses, but I believe I did not smoke enough to elicit those effects. I don't believe what i saw was extraterrestrial, but i do believe it was real. It was an unidentified flying object. I'm a fan of the principle of parsimony so i believe there is a logical explanation of what i witnessed.\n\n**TL;DR:** Got high during a meteor shower, saw a bright light make a dash through the clouds and turn 90 degrees, dash through more clouds and disappear.", "I was about 8 years old when I had the worst nightmare of my life.\n\nI was lying in my bed when a dark figure climbed through my bedroom window. I was a master of pretending to be asleep (the perks couldn't be overlooked- missing CCD, Mass, and getting carried in from long car rides and tucked in) so I did the same as I was carried through my window. It felt so surreal, at this point I realized it was a dream. Eyes still closed, I only had the sensation of ascension. I felt myself stop, and opened my eyes to a dark room with reddish lights. I can't properly describe it, as it was long ago, in a dreamy state, and plus it was just otherworldly. I felt just a soft pinch on the back of my left hand and the front of my right. Next thing I knew, I was back in my bed with the uncontrollable urge to cry. I ran downstairs to my babysitter and just cried in her arms. She did the classic \"it was just a dream\".\nAnd obviously, I believed it.\n\nIt wasn't until the next morning I noticed the scarring on the back of my left hand, as well as the noticeable metal (about the size of a small ball bearing) under the skin of my right palm. The next few years, the metal would often cause my skin to bubble up around it, cause warts, set off metal detectors, and confound every doctor I went to. It was noticeably more irritable in places like church, airports, and next to circuit breakers. I never got it removed, because I was scared of being anesthetized, and I kind of liked feeling different having it there. Five years after the incident, the metal fell out on it's own, and now my skin is just slightly grayed there. I believe it was aliens with all my being. I also still have the scar on my left hand, though it has shrunken considerably.

Now I couldn't tell you consciously who he was but I've just felt his presence.\n\nHe floated or had this strange way of walking in a fluid way. It seemed like he just levitated to me. First I could see his big, white head which had a strangely flat profile.\n\nHe approached me. His face was no more than 30 centimetres from mine.\n\nHe was a typical alien grey. But he was not short. I am 185cm and he was slightly higher than me.\n\nHe approached me so close that I couldn't really see anything else besides his big, black almond eyes. He stared at me, or through me. With each passing second I've felt like I was getting closer and closer to him.\n\nNow, immediately when he approached my face, he started doing something. I don't believe in ghosts but what he did I can only compare to eating my soul. I've felt like he took the deepest part of my very being.\n\nHe started showing me things, displaying feelings to me. It was so intense I couldn't really process it counsciously. It was dozens of different sensations, pictures of ending earth. He showed me why I was insignificant. I remember hearing hundredths of souls screaming as they couldn't handle the experience. He showed me what he did to them.\n\nI wanted to turn my head from him but I couldn't. His head was attracting my sight like a strong magnet. I could see vibrations coming from around his head\n\nWhen he wasn't projecting feelings to me, he was saying something to me, or maybe communicating thoughts. It will sound strange but he did not talk to me in a language yet I could hear his voice. It was the most powerful thing I've ever heard and it was inside of my head. His thoughts were so extremely well put.\n\nI've tried to fight this entry into my head but I've never felt so overhelmed. I can compare it to dueling a modern computer in arithmethics using only abacus.\n\nNow I don't believe he was evil. What he has shown me was that we as a humanity are really not worth that much. He showed me my struggles, what I care for and then made me realise it's really insignificant. He projected to me that we are a part of a bigger scheme but we are truly redudant. They have a need for us but it's just a part of their plan and they know many other worlds?\n\nNext thing I remember, I woke up in the morning. I've told everyone about it.

He projected omnipotence and a deep sense of knowing.\n\nWhat I also remember is that there were other beings like him but they really weren't separate. They either were different avatars of him or they formed a collective consciousness/had one purpose in mind.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why would he visit me and do those things?

Both of us saw it, both of us asked each other if we had seen it. Each of us told the other we had. I don't know how much more verifiable a UFO sighting gets. \n\nAnyhow, we were standing there chatting on the porch, when suddenly directly above us appeared five massive perfectly round, solid white lights in the sky.

They were arranged in a T shape, with three lights forming a line, with two on either side of the light on the end. We stared at them for probably five seconds before it suddenly moved away so fast it almost, almost seemed to simply vanish. I say almost, because there was a distinct acceleration, almost the way the Enterprise blasts into warp drive. We could see all of the lights start to move at once, as though attached to the bottom side of a larger dark object, and then it was just gone. \n\nI looked at him, he looked at me.

When the friend and his dog showed up, neither of them had seen or heard anything, though they were past the dunes and away from the beach.\nBut here's the kicker- my teacher and his girl went back to his parent's house after, and immediately started telling what they saw. His skeptical parents devised a clever solution to prove if the story was true- they brought each of them into a different room, gave them a blank sheet of paper and a pen, and had them independently draw the ship they had seen.\n\nThey both drew the exact same picture, with the same shape and ring of lights around the middle, and estimated its width and distance from the shore similarly.\n\nAt this point telling our class the story, my teacher drew the ship on the white board for added visual effect, and it was a wide oval with a ring of lights in the middle and a bright light on the bottom.\n\nI'm not sure if alien abductions and whatnot are true, but hearing this guy tell this story was impressive.", "I was in elementary school in the mid-90s, and an ice storm had blown through putting our power out. We lived far in the country, about 10 miles outside of a town of 9,000. It was cold and my parents let us kids camp in the living room next to the fire. I woke up in the middle of the night, and stepped outside to take a pee. Our house has a nice west facing patio that my brothers and I prefer to use do to the satisfaction of peeing off high places (maybe 6 feet up). As I stood there looking at the stars I noticed a small light in the sky, far away but jumping randomly around about a 3 inch diameter in the sky. It would jump around, stopping momentarily and shoot to the another spot. I just stood there and watch it for a about a full minute while I finished business, and thought I could go back inside and get one of my brothers. Unfortunately it just faded after awhile, and all I have is a story.  ", "Until I had my own UFO experience, I was one of the biggest naysayers around. \n\n2011, sometime in November in Los Angeles\n\nI was at a friends kickback in Beverlywood and stepped away from the party to smoke a cigarette. My car was parked on the same side as the house we were chilling at, so I walked over to the driver's side and leaned against the door and lit up that bad boy. As I smoked my cigarette, I noticed orange dots in the sky, above the treeline(8-10ft.). At first, I thought my eyes were messing with me. I closed my eyes for a few seconds to rest them, then took another gander and the orange dots were still there. Upon further squinting at the night sky, I realized there were orange dots taking up my entire field of vision. I figured my eyes were messed up and I needed glasses(I have 20-18 vision, so not really the case).\n\nThen, all the dots started moving to my right. Very slowly, but there was movement. I used the trees, telephone poles...anything I could use as a reference point. As this enormous connect the dot structure was moving, I noticed a spherical indentation towards the bottom. This intrigued me. This sphere made me think, holy shit - could this be an UFO? I started to walk in the direction it was moving, fumbling for my phone. The object picked up speed at an INCREDIBLE rate, I mean...I think I saw it go 'warp' speed. At any rate, this object larger than my field of vision was stationary for a cool minute or two then simply vanished into the distance in no less than 5 seconds once it picked up velocity.", "My mom tells a story of her and her friend. Let's call her friend Lisa. \n \nWhen my mom and Lisa were teenagers, they were up on the roof of Lisa's house, and they see a bright light in the sky. Next thing they know, the light is gone. Thing is, they think they've been on the roof for like 15 minutes, but something like 3 hours passed. \n \nMom doesn't remember anything about what happened during that time, and Lisa simply refuses to talk about it. She would answer my mom with things like \"I dunno\" and \"Just drop it.\" for a long time. \n \nSo a couple months later, mom moves away and loses contact with Lisa for about 10 years. She finally meets up with her again and immediately notices that something is odd about Lisa. \n \nLisa appeared very \"distant\" to her, with a very \"dreamy\" demeanor. Like she was really happy and at peace, for no good reason. After they talk for a bit, Lisa brings up the incident on the roof. Mom says she still doesn't really remember anything about it. \n \nBut Lisa remembers. She remembers everything. She said that at first, it was all in bits and pieces and she couldn't remember any of it clearly. She was confused and scared and wanted to avoid discussing it. Then, as time passed, she began to remember more of it. \n \nShe remembers it all clearly, and she remembers the other 3 times she was abducted after that clearly as well. At first, they paralyzed her somehow and did all sorts of invasive experiments on her, but by the most recent time, they stopped probing her and began to talk with her. They didn't speak English or any other human language, but she could understand everything they said, even though she can't speak their language herself. Apparently they told her all sorts of things - stuff about space, Earth itself, and most shockingly, predicted years beforehand that she would get pregnant in a specific year and it would also be a stillborn, and that she would never be able to have children again. They also told her that it was not their fault and they even made an attempt to save her from this fate, but they were unsuccessful. \n \nThey also told her that they had abducted my mother. Another time, after that first incident. Mom says she has no recollection of any other potential abductions, but she does have recurring nightmares of being abducted, but she's \"almost sure\" that they're just that - nightmares. \n \nAnyway, Lisa tells mom that every time she speaks with them, she comes to understand \"the truth\" more and more. When mom inquires what \"the truth\" is, Lisa just says that \"you will know eventually\", and she says that once she learned of \"the truth\", then \"everything became wonderful\". \n \nMom has seen her a few more times over the years (we still live in another state from her), and she apparently has a pretty normal life, and doesn't like, obsess over alien stuff (like some supposed alien abductees do), she only ever brings it up in passing, not like it's a central part of her daily life.\n \n**TL;DR: Aliens abduct my mom and her friend.

I was cleaning up around my apartment when I noticed my kitchen lamp swinging and my building rocking. Obviously, earthquake. It lasted for a bit and I called my friend to make sure she was ok. As we were chatting, I was standing out on my balcony which overlooks Runyon Canyon, a popular hiking trail. I suddenly noticed this object hovering high in between the mountains. \n\nIt was way too high to be a helicopter, and too small and low to be a plane. What made it SUPER strange, was it's shape and lack of movement. It was orb-esque, and stood stagnant for about a solid 3 minutes before moving at a SNAIL'S PACE to the west. I'm talking slower than any aircraft, blimp, kite, whatever, that I've ever seen. It also seemed to reflect off the sun, but only at some angles.\n\nI grabbed my crappy digital camera and tried to capture it as best I could. After moving towards the left and then once again staying completely still, it immediately darted at what seemed like an impossible speed in the opposite direction upwards and disappeared.\n\nPlain old man made, government, or other, it was one of the weirdest / best sightings I've ever experienced, especially since it was in broad daylight!\n\nWhen I looked through the pictures, I thought I got nothing, but after zooming in I noticed the object showed up in three!

They appeared to be on a craft of the same shape. I grabbed my closest camera and by the time I started recording, the first one had \"ascended\" and another one behind it was following the same path. You can see in the video that I set the camera down for a sec to grab my wife for a witness. Sorry for the poor quality, I was way too excited. For a full disclaimer, this was shot on the west side of Chicago, facing north. One could make the argument that it was a plane from O'Hare.

I agree, he picks me up, and we head out to the Mogollon Rim. \nIt gets dark before we get there and rains a little bit. Very weird vibe, we pass a stranded motorist, and we are usually the type to stop and help but we decided against it. \n\nAs we get close to the camp site, I see what I think is a tent with a lantern in it (it is glowing bright yellow/orange) in the distance, a little lower in elevation than we were. As we keep driving, it doesn't seem to get any closer until it randomly moves and gets bigger. That's when we realize it isn't a tent. I tell him to stop the car, he does, and shuts off the lights.\nThe light slowly gets bigger and kind of twists, and slowly moves from left to right. Then after about 2-5 minutes, it gets a little smaller then shoots straight out to 12 o'clock until it wasn't visible anymore. When it left, it left VERY fast. And when it left, it lit up the forest. That's when i realized we were looking over the edge of the rim.\n\nWe both agreed that we didn't know what the fuck it was, and it was probably an alien.

We were driving back from school and drove on a public road that cut through a Dow Corning plant.

My parents had gone out and left us with my uncle who was asleep upstairs. We paused the movie and gave my friend some money to go to the corner store about 2 minutes away because they had glass bottled cokes. About 20 minutes later and he hadn't shown up. I wondered what took him so long so I stepped outside to see if he was coming. As soon as I did, probably about 50 or more feet directly above me, I saw the bottom of a spinning UFO. It had about 12 or so spinning lights. I stood there in awe for about 10 seconds until I realized wtf I was watching. At that point I called my little brother out to see it. He came running out and asksd me what it was. I said I didn't know. Then in the snap of a finger it just went about 60 feet (at the same height) to my right over my apartments parking lot. I ran towards it barefoot because I didn't want to lose sight of it. As soon as I got under it the thing just zoomed straight over these other apartments and into the sky in another snap of a finger. I will never ever forget that speed. Its what made it real for me. That UFO truly changed the person I was."]["I used to work at a massive natural gas processing plant in Canada's north. One day we were outside trying to relight a massive furnace that is approximately the size a small skyscraper, probably about 14 stories. This is a very dangerous job and as a result only 2 people are ever assigned to it to minimize potential causalities. \n\nThis furnace ran off of fuel gas, that we get to use for free as it isn't commercial grade. What makes it commercial grade you ask? The addition of Mercaptans, the chemical that gives natural gas its distinctive odour. Without them the gas is odourless, which makes it very dangerous. \n\nAnyway there we were about to light a flare and attach it to the end of the stick to light this sucker, a very technical operation I know. When I look down and notice the ground is blurry. That's right the ground was fucking blurry! I realize that was because there was a leak in one of the main fuel lines running to the furnace. I look over at my co-worker who was in the process of lighting the flare. I wrap my hands around the flare in his hand so he couldn't strike it, he was about to strike it. it was loud so I had to get up real close like I was about to profess my love for him.\n\nCue and awkward pause and then I pointed out the gas situation. Anyone who works in the industry should point out we should have had a gas monitor on us, which we did but it was out of batteries because the site was very bad for maintenance. \n\nThe situation was resolved without further hassle. I still remember quite clearly how calm I was. I went home and got on my computer and signed up for university that night. I quit upon my acceptance several months later and have never looked back.

Financial circumstances had me living in Highland Park which is a couple miles up Woodward, on the City bus line.  Living there was extremely cheap - in a surprisingly pristine apartment that had just been renovated because of a fire the prior year.  It was extremely cheap because Highland Park is by most definitions, living in the ghetto.  \n\nOne day, I was standing on the sidewalk on Woodward Ave, waiting for a bus.  Woodward a very wide main surface street.  It has a turning lane in the middle.  A car skidded to a Starsky and Hutch stop in the turn lane.  The passenger jumps out, lays a gun on the roof of the car, pointing in my direction.  This is where things start slowing down.  I saw a puff of smoke come from the barrel of the gun, followed by glass exploding behind me, and a \"pop\" followed by several other pops.  At first I was confused as to whether the worst threat was coming from the gun, some 40 feet away or behind - with the glass exploding and all.  The guy next to me, grabbed his toddler, tucked him under like a football and hauled ass out of there.  I hit the deck and belly crawled to the next store - calling 911 (and being put on hold).  To their credit, the authorities were there very quickly.  I was not hurt other than a couple bruises from hitting the deck, scratches from belly crawling.\n\nI learned the whole story later:  The car in the road was occupied by two teenagers.  They had been thrown out of the store owner's store earlier that day for suspected shoplifting.  They saw the store owner in the window, behind where I was standing, stopped, and opened fire. The glass exploded after it was hit by bullets.  The store owner was wounded, but not seriously.  In Highland Park, impulse ruled.  Life was cheap.

We were at \"big beach\" on Maui (if you've been to Maui you've probably been there or at least heard of it).\n\nFeeling rather adventurous after having gone through the bulk of my trip already, hiking in the forests, snorkeling and taking a helicopter ride, I wanted to cap things off with some body surfing, as I never cared much for boards.\n\nThe surf at big beach was really tiny, I mean like 1ft. or less, nothing that could be ridden more than a few feet, but on the other side of a small cliff was a smaller \"clothing optional\" beach, and from what I could see from a distance, the surf was much better there (~3-4ft) thanks to the beach's better topography.\n\nBeing a clothing optional beach, there are signs everywhere that there are no lifeguards and that you swim at your own risk. Having taken Junior Lifeguards as a young kid, and grown up in a beach town, I was pretty confident, despite not having spent any serious time in the water for a few years.\n\nI swam out, caught one wave and rode it for maybe 20 yards, then headed back out for some more.\n\nBy this time the set of waves was moving a little further from shore (perfectly normal if you don't know, waves come in \"sets\" where they will move closer/further to the shore in cycles) so I swam hard to catch up with the set in anticipation of a nice easy ride back close to shore when I caught up.\n\nWell, I caught up to the waves right as the set got to it's furthest out point, so I started to swim at them from behind, getting ready to drop in on the next good looking one I saw....\n\nThe next wave broke a ways (maybe 15-20feet?) in front of me... \"No big deal\" I thought, as I turned on the gas, swimming hard with my head down to catch up to the set, again anticipating a nice easy ride back to shore in reward for my efforts...\n\nWell, while I wasn't wrong about the set having turned around and going back to shore, the situation was much, much worse than that.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of heavy swimming, with the waves getting further and further away from me, I took a glance at the shoreline... Everything looked TINY... I realized then, I was caught in a rip tide. Not a little one like I had felt back on the beaches in my home town, a full on, undertow inducing, suck you out to sea and never let you come back riptide.\n\nHaving been trained for this (Junior Lifeguards), I knew what I had to do was to swim sideways, however, despite being a \"strong\" (read: fast) swimmer, it had been a few years since I'd been in the water, as I mentioned earlier, and my arms were already on fire from swimming full speed to try and catch up with the waves for so long with my diminished stamina.\n\nIt was the perfect storm... I was:\n\n* By myself\n* Out of shape\n* Without a lifeguard\n* Caught in a riptide\n* Completely exhausted\n\nI had completely misjudged the situation, and my own capabilities... after maybe 50 yards of swimming to one side to try and get free of the rip, it became completely apparent to me that I did not have nearly enough strength, even with the adrenaline surging through me to get back to shore without assistance.\n\nI screamed for help, what I imagine must have been a bloodcurdling scream as I used up most of my air, before my arms seized up and refused to paddle and keep me afloat... I started to sink...\n\nThere had been other people in the water, but they were a far ways away from me, and I knew in my head that if I sunk now, they were too far away to get to where I was, and find me under the dark water in time to save me...\n\nAs I sank, I looked up at the surface of the water... maybe 8-10ft above me now, and began to resign myself to death. Having just lost a majority of my oxygen before going under (the scream + exhaustion) my lungs were already burning after only seconds under the water. I was going to die, I knew it.\n\nI sank a few more feet, and finally my self preservation instinct kicked back in. I summoned up all the strength I could and made a break for the surface, kicking and paddling as hard as I could.\n\nI breached the surface for maybe 5 seconds, exactly long though to get a big gulp of air, and scream \"HELP!!!!\" as loud as I possibly could. I didn't have time to look around and see if anyone had been coming from my previous scream, it took everything I had just to get to the surface for that one last scream.\n\nIn my head, I was praying that someone had heard my first cry for help, and that the second gave them enough time, and a good enough location to get to me, find me and save me... but in my head, I didn't think it was going to happen.\n\nI sank... again... staring up at the surface of the water and thought \"This is it, I'm going to die. There is nothing I can do about this.\" I assume I was crying, but being under the water I'd have no way of knowing.\n\nJust as I got a few feet down, and had given up on life, a shadow appeared above me. I gave a single kick (about all I had strength for) and reached up, grasping the arm that I now saw in the water above me.\n\n2 young surfer dudes hauled me up on to one of their boards as I coughed up seawater and clung to it for dear life. What my muscles had lacked in swimming stamina they were now making up for in white knuckle finger strength, gripping the board as my only salvation from death.\n\nThe two surfers got on either side of me, and kicked/paddled us back to shore. When we finally got there, I frantically got off the board, wanting to be far away from the water ASAP. I think I may have grazed one of the dudes' nuts with my foot as I got off the board. I stumbled forward, and mumbled \"thank you\" (the best I could do given my traumatized/exhausted state) - managed to teeter my way over to the cliffside... laid down in the shade, threw up, and fell asleep for 2 hours.\n\nI bring a board out in the water now.

ALL THE WAY. 9 times out of 10 you'll now slide right into the spot. Again, instinct will tell you when it's time to straighten out a bit. If you're not perfectly in the spot and you don't need to completely pull out and try again, adjust by always stopping completely and turning your wheel fully to the side you are turning into. I see so many people struggle because they are coasting and turning their wheel slightly. Always stop, turn your wheel all the way one direction, and then move. Also, don't be embarrassed to completely start over. You'll save time in the long run rather than moving and inch this way and an inch that way to get into the spot. I almost never do that anymore.

You won't be able to.\" by the driver)\n\nAll this time I was certain that I was fine, I just needed some water (I was SOO thirsty) and a nap. The next thing I remember, I was in a hospital bed on a ward and it was dark. I hadn't a clue what was going on. I have never felt so ill or weak. My mum was with me but she was playing a prank on me, making me drink vinegar (my mother obviously wasn't playing a prank on me, I was delirious, she was trying to get me to drink a potassium supplement the nurse had given her).\n\nThe next day, I felt far better, I was rehydrating and my readings were all returning to normal (blood glucose was still crazy but improving). After 4 (or 5, I'm not sure) days in the hospital I was still incredibly weak (I lost 80% of my body fat and most of my muscle) but well enough to go home. Still on insulin, as I always will be.\n\nI had gone comatose in the ambulance. I was in the advanced stages of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and I was dying. If not for the wonders of modern medicine I would be dead. Say what you will, I love (and owe my life to) the NHS.\n\nSo, to summarise, I was lucky because I woke up early in the morning and had the strength to get to my parents. I went comatose at around 7/8am. At the time I was waking up at around noon at the earliest, if not later than that. Had I not woken up, if something in my body had not said \"Get up, you need to get up!\" my parents would never have thought to check up on me until much later and I would most probably be dead.\n\ntl;dr: I very nearly died but didn't.", "My girlfriend was pregnant with her ex's baby.", "Thats rough buddy", "At least she didn't turn into the moon.\n", "Im pretty sure saka prefers moonlady over cheating lady", "*sokka", "Zuko?

I had brought one joint for us to enjoy, but we never got a chance to enjoy it.\n\nI was driving a rather beat up Pontiac Sunbird that belonged to a friend of my mom's.  I had the joint in the back of a pack of cigarettes, which was in my duffle bag, which was in the back seat.  Otherwise, the car was pretty trashy - junk mail and fast food trash all over the floors, our luggage from the trip, grocery bags full of things my mom inevitably sends home with me.\n\nSo, we're on the interstate and see a sign for a drug check ahead.  I panicked and took the next exit, like an idiot.  Of course, I drove right into the drug check, in my trashy car with out of state plates.\n\nThe officers asked why I took the exit (there were no points of interest or even restaurants). I told them I had to pee.  They checked our ID's, had us turn out our pockets, then asked if I minded if they let the dog walk around my car.\n\nI was young and stupid and not aware of my rights and I let them.  \n\nThe dog hit on my car.\n\nHe asked if I had drugs.  I insisted that I didn't.  He asked if anyone had ever had drugs in the car.  I told him the car did not belong to me.  He asked to search.  I gave permission. \n\nAt this point, I avow to myself that I will take total blame.  I can feel the handcuffs already.  I'm rehearsing what I'll say to my mom when I call her from jail.\n\nSo, a group of officers search my car, which is no small task being that it is so full of junk.  One officer pulled the cigarette pack out of my duffle and took a precursory glance inside it.  I remarked to my friend how chilly it was outside. I was shaking.\n\nAfter what seemed like an hour, but was probably only about 10 minutes, the officers got in a huddle.

", "Would have been awesome if the joint was gone.", "aww, the REAL reason they do those checks...", "12 years ago, I’m serving a Mormon mission in Brazil.  I’m assigned to a poverty stricken area of Curitiba, a city of about 2 million people.  I’m 20 years old, young enough to think I’m invincible and stupid enough to not heed the advice to stay out of this particular neighborhood.  This is one of those “favelas” that you hear about in the news.  Houses made of plywood, cardboard and tarp; a river of feces, trash and decaying dog carcasses; red dirt roads that turn into streams during rainstorms and a whole lot of people walking around that didn’t really have anything to do other than observe those who didn’t belong.  This is the same place where you read about nightly murders in the newspaper. The problem was, this neighborhood was right in the middle of our area and it made it difficult to get from one side to the other without passing through.  Although my mission companion and I had been through the neighborhood a handful of times during the day, we had never ventured to pass through at night.\n\nWell, this night a meeting of ours goes particularly late at night and we are dead tired after a long day. From where we are, we are going to have to walk around the outside of the favela to get home and that was about an hour-long walk.  Instead, we decide to cut through the favela to cut it down to about 20 minutes.  At first, the decision seems like the right one.  The moonlight is blanketing the road, the night is freezing but still, and even though there is always the lingering stench of rotting dogs, it just isn’t that bad tonight. The road we choose to walk down is the same one we’ve used in the past, but now that it’s night I start to realize some things I hadn’t before.  The road is like a chute, without any roads intersecting it.  It’s like a long hallway of back-to-back shanties and decaying cement buildings with no exit other than the two ends.  As we walk, I start to see figures in the shadows ahead on both sides of the road.  As we get closer, the figures start to meander to the middle of the road.  My companion, who has only been in Brazil for about a month is oblivious to anything going on.  I casually look behind me to reconsider our choice of road, and I see five figures, evenly spaced across the road, walking toward us.  I turn back and see the figures ahead of us have formed a line across the road as well.  By this point, even my naïve little friend knows we’re screwed.\n\nAs we approach the group I notice that the men all wearing heavy black clothing: big coats, baggy jeans, boots, hoodies, winter caps.  But one detail struck me immediately.  All of them are wearing at least one article of clothing bearing an emblem I knew very well. It was the Wu-Tang logo. Mind you, I was obsessed with Wu-Tang in high school and knew pretty much anything there was to know about the group.  As we come to a stop, the men behind and in front of us form a circle around us.  The man directly in front of us asks, “Perdidos?” and the man to his left reaches into his coat and begins to pull out what looks like the back of a black semi-automatic handgun.  Before he pulls the gun from his coat, I almost subconsciously blurt out the only thing I could think to say: in Portuguese, I ask “You guys are Wu-Tang fans?” The man pulling the gun immediately pauses. The man who first spoke asks “What do YOU know about Wu-Tang?” I respond by telling him that I’m a huge fan and I know all about them.  Obviously they doubt everything I’m saying.  After all, I’m a white kid, wearing a white shirt and tie, with a part in my hair. At that moment I began to realize how I wouldn’t believe myself either. They begin to quiz me! One thing after another—names, nicknames, alternate names, rapping styles—I’m nailing it all and I haven’t listened to the stuff in years! After about 10 minutes of Wu-Tang trivia, they’re convinced and they ask us to come back with them to one of the guys' houses to watch the latest video.  They told us repeatedly how we were the coolest white people they knew.\n\nFrom that day on, we were in with the local gang and you really don’t know just how good of a thing that is until you have it.\n\n**Tl;dr** - If you're going to visit Brazil, get up to speed on your Wu-Tang just in case.\n\nEdit: werds\n\nEdit 2: That top-comment dude drinks way too much soda.\n", "Hello, my name is Elder Ghostface...

Tell me you don't know any college age guys who make idiotic decisions on a daily basis. Mormon college-age guys are exactly the same, with maybe the exception of not having alcohol for an excuse for their behavior. The Hunt's Point bit I mentioned, was specifically as a result of me being in a place and time I was very clearly and directly told not to be in. Honestly, looking back 15 years later, there's a lot of stuff I did on my mission that I'm just so grateful I wasn't more of an idiot or I'd be dead for sure.\n\nThere are very extensive safety policies put in place for the missionaries, and you wouldn't believe how many rules there are. Worldwide, you're not allowed to swim, rollerblade, skateboard, carry weapons (although I knew sister missionaries who carried mace), not be alone with children .... seriously. There's a whole book of rules. Not to mention each mission often has rules specific to their region. However, the effectiveness of those rules are largely dependent on the willingness of those missionaries to actually obey them. So you can guess, every former LDS missionary has a handful of stories of where he made it out alive by the skin of his teeth, even if he served in Des Moines, Iowa.

This took place in the mean streets of San Miguel de Tucuman, Argentina. We also had a bad  neighborhood that we were advised to not go in, especially after dark. We had been there during the day and it was sketchy.  On one occasion a police officer on a dirt bike told us we should stay out of that neighborhood. \n\n\nA few weeks later my companion and I found ourselves in that neighborhood right around dusk. We decided it would be wise to start making our way out. I noticed there was an abandoned rail line that led out of the 'villa', so we started walking. As we got further I noticed the banks surrounding the rail got higher and higher until it was nearly a 10 ft drop down to the tracks with the backs of shanty houses at the top of the walls. There literally was no way out except forward or backwards. \n\n\nAbout 10 min into our walk I glanced back and noticed we were being pursued, I could make out 3 individuals, and they were running. We picked up our pace a bit and were getting close to an outlet, but they were gaining on us. My adrenaline started to kick in, I started to look for a place to hide or a rock to throw if I had to. Within a minute they were on us. It was 3 teens, none looked older than 16. One of them motioned and yelled for me to hand him my bag (i had a crappy camera, some church books and maybe 10 dollars on me) and reached for something in his waistband. I unhooked it from my back and was just about to hand it over when my companion reaches down into his sock and pulls out a switchblade knife and starts screaming, \"CIA, CIA, CIA!\" The kids look at him, look at each and turn and run back to where they came from. \n\n\nWe were off free, but I was pissed at my companion and it took me a good 24 hours to get my heart rate back down. \nWe were always advised to not carry valuables and to surrender belongings if confronted. Carrying knives is obviously not advised and his action could've gotten us killed. Later that night I informed our leadership of what took place and within days we were reassigned to a new area on the other side of town. \n\nTl;dr never underestimate your loose cannon colleague.

I needed money, so I picked up a few holiday hours at my old part-time retail job at Old Navy.  The only trouble was that I was visiting so I didn't have my car.  Luckily, my little sister was willing to schlep me around, drop me off and pick me up.  Our parents were really conservative, so this was a nice way for her to get out of the house without too many questions.\n\nOn one such night, she came by to pick me up at closing, and we decided to hang out for a little while before heading home.  It was late, so we ate at Denny's and relaxed for a bit.  By the time we got home, it was close to 1 a.m.  My sister parked on the street and we headed inside.  The street outside the house connected immediately to a major highway (Pittsburgh is funny that way) but the street itself always felt secluded and quiet.\n\nA couple minutes later, I was upstairs in my room (which faced the street) and heard the craziest sound I'd ever heard.  Like a series of explosive smashes followed by a screaming sound.  I ran to the window and saw a pickup truck basically entwined with my sister's car -- which was now the length of my armspan rather than a four-door sedan.

There's about 20 of us that show up, to this *one* camp site (looking back now, I can't believe we were this stupid). Now to top this all off, we decided to get there right around 8:30 p.m., well after the park's office had closed. So we drop some money into the box to pay for our overnight parking, and to pay for an overnight camp; it's just enough so that in the morning we can wake up, and go pay for the campsite properly.\n\nWell, we all get completely trashed. It's a great night, we have a fire pit and the whole nine. The next morning, we all go out swimming and are just enjoying the day.\n\nRight around 9 a.m. a park ranger pulls up, and asks what we're doing. We inform him that we've paid to stay overnight, and planned to head up around 10 to pay for the rest of today. He begins to tell us, in a very stern voice, that we should've been up there to pay right when the office opened, around 6. He then notices the dogs some people have bought that aren't on a leash, which directs his attention to our camp site. Of course, there's two cases of beer placed ever so obviously on the table; and this is a violation of park rules.\n\nHe then proceeds to call the local police. The officer comes to the camp grounds, and asks us for all of our ID's. It's at this point that I realize the most crucial detail of the story: **I'm the only person left here who is over the age of 21**. Everyone else who was over 21 left late last night, or early that morning.\n\nSo naturally, after looking at our IDs for a whole 15 seconds, the officer calls me over. Luckily, just before he has called me to him, I let everyone know that I planned to inform the officer that I had only arrived this morning, with a friend of mine (the friend was actually there, and had actually just arrived this morning).\n\nSo, I feed the officer my story, and all he responds with is: \"Son, you realize I could take you to jail right now, no questions asked? Open and shut case?\". This is point where I started to become extremely nervous.\n\nHe then asked me a few more questions, and then went silent for two minutes, just staring at the IDs. He then proceeds to walk behind me, and asks me to put my hands behind my back.

I handed a hock to a new girl and told her to go put it in the pen- she didn't close the doors or lock the gate properly either.\n\nSo, there I am, standing over bloody pig, covered in its blood as well, with my back to the lion's pen... when suddenly, one of the girls gets wide-eyed and says \"LION.\" It took a second to register what was happening, but we all ran inside. The lion was not interested in the meat, nor chasing us apparently (thank God, because running was stupid). He was an old lion and somehow managed to lift the drop gate, even though he should not have been able to. He was distracted by a young tiger in his pen, and then wandered off towards the barn...\n\nWe all gathered inside and counted heads. One girl was missing. Thankfully she was one of the few of us who had a radio, and we called to warn her. She was in the barn, and saw the lion coming, and climbed into the rafters... mind you, she is now perched over the cages of tigers, lions, etc.\n\nThe owner loaded up a dart gun, shot the lion 3 times, and he fell asleep. Sadly, due to age and an overdose of medication, the lion never woke up. The owner was so pissed at me that he sent me home the following morning. I had to drive 13 hours back across the country with no notice, in tears, and feeling like shit because I, an aspiring conservation biologist, effectively just eliminated 1% of an endangered species.\n\nBut, none of us were hurt (aside from the lion), so... lion dodged.", "That's pretty shitty on the sanctuarys part for not training you properly.

He did talk, however, when the men threatened to trash his 57' Bel air that he had fully restored and loved so much. \n\nAfter they got what they wanted they talked amongst themselves for a minute or so and made a decision, some of the lights where on in the living room while all this was happening, one of the men with his gun shot the lights that where on out, and the men took off the ski masks they had on and then the men pointed their guns on my grandfather, grandmother, and my uncle (who was the one who made connections for my grand parents and set up deals). \n\nJust before anything could happen the police arrived, A.J. who i had mentioned above, was put in one of the bathrooms in the house with a phone by my uncle who before he was discovered figured out what was happening and called 911, A.J. hid and stayed on the phone with the police and they managed to get to us in time.\n\nWall of text i know but it is one of the few times in my life that i really did believe i was going to die. The people that did it knew enough as far as the color of the lockbox and what was inside to assume they where customers or got information from customers, and when the cops got inside the men ran out the back, actually running clean through a sliding glass door and knocking flat a panel of fencing.\n\nAs you would guess my grandparents stopped selling and nothing like that ever happened again, but i always think what could have happened if the cops came a minute or so later or if my uncle and his friend had stayed out that night, if anyone else would have been able to call the cops.\n\nTL:DR, came very close to being killed in a home invasion caused by my grandparents selling oxy.\n", "I was at university and it was 2am on a Saturday.

Assholes got the cops called or summoned from outside. The 90% with a brain got to try somewhere else.\n\nUsing someone else's ID was always safer than altering one. In FL the ID numbers used to start with the first letter of your last name, had your birth year in them, and also your birth month with the year after your birth. Example: If your name was John Smith and you were born Feb 1, 1972, your ID number might be S384-72-273-109.

Most people know theirs, but if they don't know it they're not going to say the wrong one. Sometimes we got them to do their signature.

On his way to the next village to peddle his wares. Out of nowhere, he falls to the ground. He looks up, bleeding from the mouth. Spitting out a tooth, he fumblingly gets in his stance, but his attacker is nowhere to be seen.  Another strike hits him in the stomach. He is quicker to react this time, and kicks out his leg on the off chance of impact. A strike to the back of his legs. On his knees. Hair pulled back. Throat slit open. Smash to black. THE SIXTH SENSEI.\n\nWe quickly learn of a battle that took place in this place a hundred years ago. A battalion of samurai, slaughtered by their own master, now holds a grudge centuries old, and are willing to take it out on anyone who steps in their domain. The travellers are slaughtered by the dozens. But one boy proves to be able to see the ghosts. He fends off one of them in his opening scene, but has to run away in order to survive. He seeks guidance from the Five Senseis of his village, who teach him the five facets of the warrior. Courage. Power. Wisdom. Compassion. Honor.  \nThe boy becomes a powerful fighter, and eventually takes on the entire horde of undead soldiers. The battle lasts days, but eventually he is triumphant. Wounded, yes. But his wounds heal, and at his journey's end, he takes his place among his masters, to become the youngest sensei in living memory.\n\nDirected by Ang Lee.", "My Cabbages!", "I see Asian people.

Blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, strawberry... they swirled around in his mouth as he gasped for air at the surprise of such taste. Banana, kiwi, orange, each flavor unique, collaborating with the others to create a spectacular taste of heaven. John's penis became erect before he could take another bite.

Don’t get me wrong, regular Sour Patch Kids are good, but after a few handfuls, they don’t taste sour anymore. A few more bites after that, and they don’t taste like anything at all. It’s just sweet, which eventually turns to not so sweet, but you can’t stop eating. You shouldn’t have bought the big bag, but the little bag doesn’t really cut it, doesn’t satisfy the Sour Patch craving, but justify the big bag purchase all you want, all you’re doing now is ruining the fun, each bite further and further diminishing your tongue’s ability to distinguish sweet from anything else, and you’re thirsty, but the water’s making you nauseous, and there’s all of the Sour Patch residue wedged deep in the spaces between your molars way, way back. It’s a mess.\n\nWith Sour Patch Watermelons, yeah, there’s a similar progression of problems, but they’re delicious, the watermelon flavor totally outweighs any of the negative consequences associated with regular Patch. I say bring on that stomachache, I’ll gladly skip dinner because I ate too many watermelons. And you get to the end of that bag and, while you still have that last mouthful only partially chewed, you tilt your head back and pour all of the leftover sour crystals down your throat, that last sour kick, man I’m salivating just imagining it, I have to ball my hands into fists with my jaw clenched, I’m shaking my head from side to side just thinking about the flavor.\n\nWhat I don’t get it why they don’t incorporate the watermelons into the regular Sour Patch mix. Yes, the Sour Patch kids are noticeably different from the watermelons, the former being in the shape of actual kids and the watermelons a little bit more realistically formed in the shape of freshly cut watermelon slices. But I wouldn’t mind the disruption in shape consistency. Maybe a few watermelon wedges would eliminate all of those Sour Patch Regular problems I was talking about in the first paragraph.\n\nMy second favorite candy is definitely Sour Gummy Lifesavers. I’m sure you’re noticing a pattern here, the gummy-like consistency, the sour crystals. I just want to make myself clear though, there are two types of Sour Gummy Lifesavers: regular, and then mixed reds. Personally, I like the regular. I like reds too, but I don’t like all reds. I’m not saying that I’d like to eat a bag of only yellows or just greens, but I find it’s through that mix that the flavors really come alive. It’s like when you’re eating Skittles (seventh favorite candy) you don’t pick out all the purples, greens, etc. It’s meant to be enjoyed as a fruit medley.\n\nThe title of third favorite candy goes to the Slim Jim. Ha, I bet you feel pretty silly for assuming that I only liked things gummy and sour. To those of you saying Slim Jims aren’t candy, I say, that’s crazy. They’re right there in the candy aisle. They go great with sweet snacks, you know, that whole sweet and savory combination that’s so popular lately.\n\nSlim Jims are great because, while candy satisfies your primal urge for sugar, it doesn’t really get at the simultaneous need for meat. And the whole point of eating snacks is usually because you’re in between meals and you’re trying to hold yourself off until lunch, dinner, or dessert. Slim Jims are perfectly spiced, just the right amount of vinegar, of heat, and of course beef. They’re amazing. They’re like little sausages on the go. And they come in so many different flavors: classic, mild, habanero, Tabasco.\n\nI was at a gas station the other day and I saw a new variety: classic, but jumbo. I don’t know if they called it jumbo or something else, but it was awesome, like as long as a regular Slim Jim, but also as thick as a breakfast sausage. I was skeptical at first, I wondered, will the subtle vinegary moistness of a regular Slim Jim be overpowering in a thicker shell? I’m glad to report that the answer was no. It’s even better, even more satisfying. Wouldn’t it be cool to have like a hot dog, but instead of a hot dog, you could just have two of those jumbo Slim Jims?

He strolled excitedly out to the nearby farms along the southwest side, picking fights with the occasional cat and chicken only to have to retreat out of fear of dying. However, he was victorious over the feeblest of targets.\n\nEager to explore and see the land, he returned to the southern road, eventually crossing the bridge on the way to Trinsic. It was here that he was ambushed by BroFist, a guild of evil brigands lead by the Dread Lord named MikeHunt.\n\n\"n00b!\" MikeHunt said as his comrades surrounded Dr_Coathanger.\n\n\"Please, I don't have anything,\" begged the young adventurer.\n\n\"CORP POR,\" replied MikeHunt while his mates said things like, \"LOL\" and \"VAS FLAM\".\n\nThe wavy line of energy sped toward Dr_Coathanger with unmatched speed. He was grossly unprepared for a fight, let alone to be attacked by an evil gang of seasoned combatants. Somehow he managed to run half a dozen steps before he was struck down and let out an awful sounding, \"Ahhuughh!\" as he fell limp to the ground.\n\nAn instant later he found himself wandering the same land, but he could not say more than, \"OoooOOooooo,\" while the BroFist gang picked at his corpse. He could do nothing because he was dead.\n\nSuddenly a robed figure appeared from thin air. The bald man, clad in dull brown, asked him, \"Would you like me to resurrect you?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" replied Dr_Coathanger.\n\nThe healer moved his arms and a spell was cast. Dr_Coathanger felt himself returned to the realm of the living.\n\n\"CORP POR,\" said a lieutenant of BroFist and Dr_Coathanger was once again felled by energy.\n\n\"VAS FLAM,\" said another of the evil band, and this time the healer was immolated to a smoldering pile of flesh.\n\nDr_Coathanger, having learned the error of his ways, immediately ran back to the city where he managed to locate a temple of healing. Once he was resurrected, he decided to stay safe while collecting the junk other adventurers left on the ground around the bank.\n\nWithout warning, a man who wore nothing but a bulging white loincloth revealed a pair of potions of grotesque green liquid and tossed them into the crowd. \"Guards!\" called out a nearby shopkeeper. Britain's security leaped into action immediately, slaughtering the crazed alchemist. The incident was not without victims, however, as Dr_Coathanger was among those splashed by the vile concoction.\n\n\"Help! Please!\" he called out while wracked with pain.\n\nAn apprentice apothecary nearby cast some sort of warm, soothing spell on him and he felt better right away. As he went back collecting unwanted treasures, he reflected on his latest brush with death and decided it would be only one of many victories in his long and storied journey throughout Britainnia.", "God the nostalgia wave from that... you described my first week in that game perfectly.", "I'm glad you enjoyed it!

Pleasuring him helps my hornyness somehow haha.", "I really really enjoy giving blowjobs.\nMostly, because my SO is great at giving feedback. He makes happy noises with no self conciousness at all, tells me what feels good, directs when he needs it harder/ gentler, faster ect. He warns me before he comes, every time, and he damn near purrs when it is over. Gets me damp, every time.\nI love the feeling of his cock in my mouth, and I love the sounds he makes. I dunno, I guess I really do like giving him pleasure, but as it becomes my own pleasure, it is hard to seperate the two. I dunno, can I answer \"both\"?\n\n*edit*: But I don't care for giving other lovers blowjobs, not nearly as much. Is it love? Is it familiarity? Is it positive reinforcement to the point I salivate when I ring his bell?  *something something...* FOR SCIENCE!", "Truthfully, it's a combination of the two. Pleasing my SO is pleasing to me. I think the most rewarding thing pertaining to blowjobs is simply the reaction I receive as I'm giving one. As I'm working, his pleasure fuels mine and encourages me/makes me want to keep going and then I really begin to get into it. Also, speaking personally here, there are some times where I'm just desperately horny and would gladly initiate a blowjob, however, I can't speak for all women.

It is also my go-to for cheering someone up. \n\nThe only downside is that sometimes, if my husband has been drinking too much coffee his cum will taste like it and I really hate coffee. Of course, if I'm deep throating the taste doesn't matter anyway. ", "It depends on the guy, just as it would for you giving head to a girl. If I love him, I love giving him blow jobs. Blow jobs, in my mind, are an expression of love. They're totally selfless and you shouldn't expect anything in return. You're doing them solely for the person you love. So they're very gratifying emotionally. \n\nI've only blown a guy I didn't love and knew I could never once, and I was so unenthusiastic about it, I ended up stopping halfway through. That was mainly because his dirty talk was so awful I just couldn't continue, though. \n\nEdit: grammar", "I like it, but it makes me horny/frustrated and after a while I just want to have sex.

It arouses the hell out of me", "I don't necessarily like performing the act, but I like knowing that I'm bringing pleasure to a guy.

Or at least my mouth", "Eating pussy is work too ladies, but its totally worth the neck cramps, chafed under-tounge area, and so on.

Irony.", "I feel like a lot of my friends don't like it, or think it's gross. Personally... I fucking love it. The action itself is kinda gross, but making my partner enjoy himself is really awesome for me.

Or is that only in porn and my fantasies?", "As a woman, I'm really curious about what other BJ-givers say about this. I always swallow, and as a fairly sheltered person, I never realized people might not swallow until it came up on reddit.\n\nEven if the come tastes bad, isn't it better to swallow it than to wait, holding it in your mouth, and then spit it out? Or is the alternative to stop the BJ right as he comes? Wouldn't that not feel good? Sorry if I sound really clueless (I am.)", "I don't mind it actually. The first time is startling because you don't expect the horrible taste (sorry). It's just so misleading. To me, cum smells so fucking delicious (kind of like chlorine...not that I'd eat chlorine, but it smells really good to me). \n\nAnyways, once you're over the taste, it's really enjoyable to swallow, lick your lips, and smile. Guys go fucking nuts over it and honestly, the taste doesn't stay long. Especially if you shove it in the back of your throat and down it like a shot.", "It's such a huge turn on if the guy is really into it. And I mean, as in he can't control how much he's into it. It's fun to tie him up and blindfold him...puts a whole different element of surprise in it for him. Plus the reactions are so hot -- him being somewhat helpless but completely overwhelmed with pleasure...\n\nMy closet doors are mirrors...it's fun to watch myself do it. Can't lie, I can see why dudes find it so enticing.", "I love it! Especially when you start off doing it, so you feel it getting really hard in your mouth. Sometimes I play with myself doing it.", "I wanted to go to sleep before I clicked on this thread, now I'm pitching a tent. ", "Yeah, love it ", "Here's the thing. I love giving blow jobs to my boyfriend because I love him.  And I wouldn't say that I'm just giving them to please him because making him feel good turns me on too.\n\nBUT back when I was single, I can't say I was actually asking to give them like I do to my SO, but I had no problem giving them if asked. In short...I didn't NOT like giving them, but when they weren't for my boyfriend, they were kind of 'whatever' for me.", "Throwaway because oh hell YES. When done properly, blowing a guy is a buffet for all the senses. And it's not only the sensuality of the situation, and the fact that it's a hugely physical and intimate way to show I love him, but it's also that is he is completely dependent on *me* making him feel *awesome*. It's a power trip, knowing that I hold all his building pleasure and anticipation in my hands... and mouth. \n", "I really love it.

Yay mouth sex.", "I love it. Especially so because he rushes through foreplay most of the times. Giving him head is a guaranteed panty fogger. Nothing gets me wetter than feeling his hand on the back of my head urging me to take more of him in. I very much so enjoy being dominated where as he is more so vanilla, but these blow job sessions...are definitely a great time for him and I both.

The one that will always stick with me though has to have been one women who wasn't wearing a seatbelt while on the highway and got in a collision. She flew out of the front windshield of the car. A few of the slides showed the trail of brain matter from her head skidding across the road. Then it got to her.  Her head looked like it was split open like a banana.

One was a late teens to early 20's girl who had just given birth less than 3 months prior. She was living with her parents and decided for some reason to slit her wrist in her bedroom. She bled out. I had to cut out the affected carpet, carpet pad, and then treat the floor underneath. You'd be surprised at how little blood there can be when someone slits their wrist. But it was an all-around sad situation. The family was there, holding the baby and were all just an emotional wreck.\n\nAnother was a guy who was pretty sick and spent all day in pain laying in bed. He finally had enough and put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. Had to pick up pieces of skull and brain matter and clean anything that blood/brain/skull/whatever could have gotten on. Was hauling the hazmat box back to the van and one of their family friends showed up being all cheerful. They saw the disaster restoration logo on the van and asked in a joking manner if one of the pipes had burst and referenced swimming in the house. Caught me completely off-guard so I stammered a bit but finally managed to say no and that the family was inside if she wanted to find out more. It was seriously one of the most awkward moments of my life because how the hell can you prepare for something like that?\n\nAnother was a double murder that occurred in a house that they were squatting in. There was blood everywhere and it was in a bad part of town so we ended up just giving an estimate and booking it. Someone else got that job.\n\nThen there was the guy who decided to commit suicide by cop while in his truck. We were asked by the police to clean up the truck. For some reason, it sat in our parking lot for a couple of weeks in the summer. I stayed the hell away from it because it absolutely reeked. Not 100% sure if we ended up taking care of it or if they got another company to do it. I just know that I wasn't part of it and the truck just wasn't there one day.\n\nThere were a few more that I did over the course of my employment but those are the ones I remember the most. However, the worst thing that I saw on that job had nothing to do with trauma cleanup. A pipe had burst at some medical office over Christmas break and we got called in to clean it up. So we're in one of the rooms soaking up water from the carpet and setting equipment to dry the room out. The room has windows that look into the neighboring room so I glance inside as I walk by. There's two women in doctor's coats standing over a counter doing....something. I can't tell what it is in the amount of time that I walk by so I continue with my job. About 10 minutes later, I pass the window again and glance in just in time to see one of the ladies step away. I get a perfect straight on view of a baby having an autopsy performed on it. It was cut open and it's insides were on full display. That definitely ruined that Christmas for me and I spent that night getting drunk.", "Damn, that baby autopsy got me :(", "Med student here.

They weren't in the same room though. They typically stayed in the living room, kitchen, or just outside of the house.\n\nAlthough, I can remember one instance where a family member was in the same room. The man had died on a couch and I believe it was his wife who was adamant about helping us get the couch out of the house and loaded onto the truck. We assured her that we could handle it easily and that she didn't need to do a thing but she insisted. I don't know if it was part of her way of saying goodbye or if she just wanted something to take her mind off of things for a few minutes. Or maybe it just hurt too much to have it in the house and she wanted it gone as soon as possible. I don't know for sure. But that's the only time that I can remember a family member being in the same room while we worked.\n\nThe absolute worst though was asking the family to sign the paperwork and authorize the charges so that we could get started. I had no say over the prices and it was very expensive for 30 minutes to a couple hours worth of work.

A few examples come to mind; the first is due to the amount of skill involved. An individual decided to commit suicide by firing both a .308 and a .30-06 rifle into his head at the same time. The photo of the crime scene showed not much more than a truncated neck with a good deal of tissue on the surrounding walls. The next photo in the intro to forensic science class presentation was the reconstructed head in the lab. It was only slightly marred by the lack of orbital sockets which seemed to have been vaporized. I'm still stunned by the amount of work that must of gone into that.\n\nAnother I recall because the sheer stupidity involved. A college student engaged in what is called 'elevator surfing' in his high rise dorm building. His head became caught in the mechanism of the elevator while he was riding on top of the car and was twisted around a few times. It was a black &amp; white photo, but you could clearly see that his faced was very discolored from asphyxiation. The accompanying report indicated that he probably retained consciousness for several minutes after the incident.\n\nThe last is just sad. When children with high melanin contest skin die, two lateral incisions are made in the gluteus maximus to check for hemotoma. It seemed unnecessary to me to include a photo of this in an intro course and I said as much to the instructor. He confessed that a big part of the photo presentation was to give an idea of what you would be confronted with in a career in forensics.

I would see his lifeless body surrounded by pools of blood on the floor of the trauma bay as doctors and nurses walked in and out of the curtained off room.\n\nI was looking for a place to cover all the commotion without being in the way when two Salinas police officers slam through the ER bay door with a bloodied up young guy is handcuffs. It was Richard Gutierrez, 22, who was being arrested for the stabbing homicide. The cops sat him down within 3 feet from where I was standing. I looked up at the same time he did and I looked straight into the eyes of a guy who had just taken another life.\n\nIn my years as a news photographer, I had never come so physically close to someone who had killed another person so recently. As our glances met, I have never seen such darkness in a person's eyes. I don't think he regretted what he had done, but I have never seen so much fear in a person before. It was surreal, because the body of the man he had allegedly killed was still in the ER, a mere 20 feet from where we sat in the hallway.\n\nI wasn't allowed to photograph a patient without their permission, but I asked Gutierrez. He refused, so I set up outside of the ER bay door for a shot of the cops dragging Gutierrez off to jail. Needless to say, he was less than happy about me taking his picture (above).\n\nI was chatting with the ER doctor about it later on and he thought for a second and said something along the lines of during all his years in the ER, he can't recall a time when he had worked on saving one person's life, then moments later, also working on helping patch up the person that killed the first one.", "this is a good story. nice pictures BTW", "A friend of my family is a crime scene photographer, I was babysitting their kids one night while his wife was on a night out and he'd had to work late.

By May I had come to almost enjoy craft beers, but bought them only in social situations. Then SHE came along. Beautiful, kind, awesome, and very importantly, she liked me. We met through some mutual friends and before long a party and copious amounts of hard liquor led to a make out session and each other's numbers. The following dates we exciting, long, tender, amazing. And she opened my eyes to the wonders and deliciousness of craft brewing. \n\nNot too long into our relationship, a camping trip up north for a music festival with a few friends came around and we went happily. She loved it, I liked it, it was nice. The highlight came on the trip back when a friend said we should stop by a brewery on the way back. I, having eaten vegetarian that weekend, wanted nothing but to go home, have sex with this wonderful woman, and eat bacon, but I gave in to this idea as I didn't want to be a spoil-sport. \n\nThe brewery: Russian River. I'll never forget the first time I entered, on a Sunday afternoon, jammed packed to the rafters. I was skeptical at first, but gave in and SHE, this beautiful goddess, offered to pay for my drink (as she actually owed me, but that's not the point). Following my friend's footstep, I order a \"Consecration\". And. I. Fell. In. Love. Not with my girlfriend (yes, we'd progressed to that point), but to the beer. It was nothing like I'd had before and I LOVED IT. I had another (on my tab this time) before we left and I knew if there was ever an opportunity to have it again, no matter the cost, I'd take it. My favorite beer from then to this moment is, was, and always will be Russian River's Consecration.\n\nI have her to thank for all this. Though she is now gone (we grew apart, unfortunately), I'll never forget the great beer experiences we had. Our northern California brewery tour of Sierra Nevada, North Coast, Bear Republic, Russian River, and Lagunitas ocured later in our relationship and was one of many highlights. I'll miss her.
