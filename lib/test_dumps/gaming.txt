It was seriously exciting and a lot of fun to roleplay.", "I dont even understand how any of that works lol", "How most table tops work: You say what you want to do. If what you want to do conflicts with someone else or something else's will or ability. You roll dice, the higher number wins the conflict and does resulting actions. \n\nThe best part of table tops is you make it your own. I've played some campaigns who strictly follow rules and battles can take 40 minutes per turn as people flip through a stack of books, arguing about how a system works. Then I've played campaigns who don't even care about a character sheet and want to tell a story. If someone argues or conflicts with something else, roll a d20, whoever wins gets to tell the next part of it.\n\nI'll give you a run through.\n\nGM: *You enter a room that is split in half with a deep pit cutting through the center*\n\nJim: I want to try and jump over the pit.

He can make him roll dice to see if he grabs the edge before falling into the pit. . . This goes on repeatedly. \n\nThe glorious part of this is you can do what ever you want. Have a 10 foot pole? Place it over the pit and try to walk across it. Have an amazing dexterity stat? Run across the wall to the other side. Want to leave the dungeon and walk away from the party? You can do that. Want to kick another player down the pit? You can do that. It's only limited by your mind and the dice. \n\nThink of the GM as the narrator, he/she sets up scenarios and characters for the players to interact with. He/she controls everyone who isn't a player. Some people like to role-play in which they actually act out the role and dialogue of their character with the GM (who will act out the role of every non-playable character) or other players.

We skipped an entire boss fight because I slashed my way through the floors of a building with my 4 tonfa lightsabers, and ended up collapsing the entire building on the boss instead of actually getting to fight him. They were throwing waves of enemies at us and just trying their best to retreat so they could escape before we finished him off, and I just shut down everything with my lightsabers.", "Appart from 4th ed, which was less make believe, more rules.", "So there are a bunch of different systems for gameplay in the tabletop world, but the D20 System that D&amp;D is based on is probably the most popular. \n\nIn the D20 system, most of what a character does is determined by how well they do on the roll of a 20 sided die, with a 20 being the best roll.\n\nGenerally a character is just like in any other RPG. They have a class, they have a race, they have stats that modify how good and bad they are at different things, they have skills, equipment, ect.\n\n**PHYSICAL COMBAT**\n\nCombat in D20 is actually a lot like combat in any RPG, the math just isn't hidden from the player. Everyone has an attack score that determines how good they are at hitting opponents. Everyone also has a defense score that determines how difficult it is to hit them. The attacking player rolls their D20 and then adds to the roll their attack score and any other modifiers like their strength/dexterity or if the weapon has a magical bonus. If the result is equal to or higher than the opponents defense, they hit. Then they roll damage which is determined by the weapon they use and other modifier like Strength and magical effects. It's important to note that almost all turn based RPGs use this system, it's just that the math is hidden from the player.\n\n**MAGIC**\n\nMagic is a bit different from video game RPGs. Rather than having a reserve of mana to draw from to cast spells, spells are instead ranked in power from 1 to 9. A player is limited in how many spells of each rank he can cast each day. For example, a 1st level character maybe be able to cast 2 or 3 rank 1 spells each day, and that is IT. As you might guess, playing a mage at early levels can be difficult. As you level up, you gain access to stronger spells and can cast weaker spells more often. \n\nMages are usually divided into two types: Prepared casters and Spontaneous Casters. A prepared caster typically has to select what spells that they want to cast in the morning and then is stuck with those spells for the day. If a spell ends up being not useful that day or if a caster really needs a spell he did not prepare...tough. Spontaneous casters select what spells they wish to cast on the fly and typically can cast more often than prepared casters. HOWEVER, a spontaneous caster only has access to a VERY limited number of spells that they can EVER cast from. So while a 5th level prepared caster may know over 100 spells, a spontaneous caster will know about 6. Furthermore, a spontaneous caster needs to wait an extra level before they earn the next rank of spells. So while a 5th level prepared caster has rank 3 spells, a 5th level spontaneous caster is still stuck at rank 2.\n\nThe biggest difference however between magic in pen and paper games and magic in video games is that magic spells are so much greater in depth and power. In a video game, magic spells can only really do about 4 things: Damage enemies, heal allies, buff allies, and debuff enemies. In tabletop RPGs, magic can be used to allow you to fly, it can be used to talk to the dead, it can be used to create obstructions like walls on the battlefield, it can be used to teleport players all over the world, it can be used to bind demi-gods, it can be used to create entire planes of existance. This is while still having all of the traditional magical powers I listed like damage and healing.\n\nIn Tabletop RPGs, the majority of spells that a player uses against enemies have what is called a Difficulty Class (DC). This determines how difficult it is to resist the spell. Each player has what are called Saving Throws that determine how good they are at resisting spells. If a player is targeted by a spell, they make a saving throw which is a D20 roll plus their saving throw modifier. If they succeed, the spell typically has either a reduced effect or is negated entirely. However, some of the best spells in the game do NOT allow for saving throws. \n\n**SKILLS**\n\nThese are things like how good you are at jumping, lock picking, riding a horse, swimming, climbing, persuading people, ect. Each skill is governed by a different ability and each class is better at certain skills. Some classes are also overall more skillful than others. As you level up, you can increase your skills. Whenever you want to use a skill, you describe what you want to do to the DM and they will decide what skill to use and what the difficulty is (The book gives the DM a LOT of guidance on how to do this, but to some degree the ultimate difficulty is up the DM). \n\nSome skills have static difficulty. For example, Climbing a wall. To climb a wall, the DM consults the book to determine what difficulty to assign to the wall. The player then rolls a D20 and adds their climb skill to the roll. If they overcome the difficulty, they succeed and climb the wall.\n\nOther skills are whats called opposed skills. For example, sneaking is considered an opposed skill. To sneak, a player rolls a D20 and adds their sneak skill (Often, a DM will ask a player what their sneak skill is and then roll the D20 themselves secretly behind a screen. This is because a player should not know how sneaky they are, but if the player rolls low, they will know that they likely failed). Once the player has rolled their sneak roll, any other players or NPCs in the are are given a Perception roll to see if they detect the sneaking player. They roll a D20 and add their Perception skill and if they beat the sneaking player's roll, they see them. \n\n**ROLEPLAY**\n\nRoleplay is really were the tabletop genre shines about other RPGs. People get frustrated when they play video game RPGs because they're often limited by how their character can react to a situation. In a tabletop game, you are free to do whatever you desire. For example, your character just rescued the princess and is brought to kneel before the king to receive his boon. What you say to the king is entirely your choice. Do you ask for her hand in marriage? Do you ask to be made a lesser noble? Do you take this opportunity to try and SLAY the king and ursurp his throne? You can certainly try (Success is not a guarantee ;P)\n\nOne of the best things about roleplaying is how it gives you a ton of freedom to approach a situation. Lets say your party has tracked a gang of bandits to a cabin in the woods. How do you approach the situation? Do you kick in the door and slay them? Do you wait until the middle of the night, sneak in and slit their throats in their sleep? Do you barricade the doors from the outside secretly and then set the building on fire? Do you summon a demon into the building to murder them? Do you create the illusion of an army outside to trick them into surrendering? Do you teleport an ACTUAL army to overwhelm them? \n\nRoleplay is where you are most freed from the rules, although your degree of freedom is determined by the DM. Roleplay however is also what makes tabletop RPGs less of a game and more collaborative storytelling. Much of what makes a game is what the players chose to do with it (this is hard to learn and manage as a DM). As a DM you have to be prepared sometimes for players to do what you didn't want/expect them to do. For example, if a video game tells the player that they have to go rescue the princess from the dragon, the player is going to do that because that's the only choice the game provides them. In a tabletop game, you have to totally be prepared for your players to say \"No, screw that, I'm going to go delve a dungeon for artifacts of power, or buy a ship and become a pirate, or start a war to take over this kingdom.\"", "Yea, at the end of any given session or group of sessions there's a really shiny thing that you and your friends want. Also, in the process of getting that thing, your character gets better. Now that you've made a name for yourself by finding shiny things, another NPC tells you about another shiny thing. Now you got yourself a game goin'.", "So can I kill everyone at the start of a game and win?", "It depends on the game. In most tabletop RPG's all of the players will team up and go on a quest, which ultimately ties together into an overall plot defined by the DM and player choices. Think of it as a co-op game, but any PC can [betray, manipulate or kill](http://i.imgur.com/Vb4dKH9.png?1) any other PC at any time. You do have unlimited freedom in what you choose to attempt to do.\n\nThere are some tabletop RPG's that encourage conflict between players, but most encourage cooperation.", "There are still stats like armor class and strength etc. They'd fight back and possibly kill you but yes, you could try to stab anything you want whenever you want. ", "It depends on how you define winning. DND is generally co-op multiplayer, not PVP (though the rules say it could be). If you're just killing to piss off the other players, then it's not really winning. It's making the game unplayable and shitty.\n\nAnd the DM is essentially god. Any DM worth his/her salt wouldn't allow you to straight up kill the other players for no reason.\n\nHaving said that, one of the best campaigns I've played was one in which our entire party of characters were evil. We roleplayed hating eachother's guts, and trying to underhandedly destroy eachother while we were more-or-less forced to work together for a series of common goals. Really fucking fun.", "There needs to be a reddit bot for this.", "It's cooperatively playing pretend, or acting out a play without a script that's written ahead of time.  One person is the Game Master or Storyteller or Dungeon Master who controls the world and all the characters NOT played by real people (Non-Player Characters, or NPCs.)  Everyone else has a character of their own.\n\nEver watch kids playing pretend?  You can get fights of \"you missed me!\"  and \"no I didn't!\"  So table-top is playing pretend with rules.  \n\nCharacters have ability scores which rank them comparatively against averages and each other.  Like we saw in the image of the original post, the highest score this Warden had was an 18 Constitution.  Constitution is the score in this system that covers how hardy someone is, how much stamina they have, how unlikely they are to get sick, and how easy it is to shrug things off.\n\nDifferent systems are out there with different scores and skills and even completely different worlds.\n\nSome terminology:\n\n**Campaign world** - the setting that the series of adventures will take place within.  Sometimes written from scratch, sometimes prewritten.\n\n**Campaign** - a series of adventures with the same characters and same overarching plot.  It's like a play.\n\n**Adventure** - a single subsection of the larger plot.  Usually what can be played out in a single session.\n\nNote:  Every game has different terminology, but the basics are the same - adults playing pretend with one person in charge of the setting.  Contests are decided through random chance by the rolling of dice.\n\n", "A guy I play D&amp;D with calls it \"storytelling jazz\" and it's the most apt description I've heard for it.

Even when those systems better model what they want to play.\n\nIt is not so much that D&amp;D is one of the least mainstream games out there.

I'd suggest looking at FATE (Core, or any of the variants, like Dresden Files RPG or Spirit of the Century) or Marvel Heroic Role Playing. \n\nThe latter is great especially for newcomers because when you start it's with established characters. Role Playing for the first time is easier when it's with a character you *know*. You don't have to think too hard to figure out how Tony Start will act.\n\nDungeon World is also great (and currently my favorite system) but it's a bit harder on the GM.

Or the time I managed to shame a big and powerful (but powerfully *dumb* construct) into letting my group pass. \n\nI played other systems, but everything seemed so... restricted.

It is a hate developed over a long time of experience. It's too simplistic in some areas, and too complex in others. It requires far too much tracking of completely inane values, and makes item-finding a boring chore. It drowns you in awful feats, powers, and other class choices, and then gives you almost nothing to grow with past level 20.

For an example of this in reverse, the Expanded Psionics Handbook in 3.5 was authored only by Bruce R. Cordell and considered good.   \n\nAnother big part of it is the company wants to keep on releasing products that people buy without really looking in depth, so lackluster feats, classes, races, etc. see the light of day even when they would have been scrapped or could have been improved.  I think Tome of Magic in 3.5 had this problem, with Truenamers (mages who can speak the language of reality) being considered unplayable past level 7.", "I didn't find it nearly as true in 3.5. Consider a level 10 character in 3.5, vs a level 15 char in 4e. How many feats do each have? What is the size of the feat list they choose from? In 4e, even using the digital character builder, it can take hours to figure out even a fairly simple (non essentials) character. Don't even think about trying to choose a strong hybrid combination.\n\nIn 3.5 you could roll up a new character in much shorter time. Your character might not have been as unique in its stat block, but that's okay, uniqueness should come from how you play it.", "A 4.0 character takes about as long to roll up as a 3.5 spell preparing caster.  Sure rolling up a class with few choices is less, but it''s that that large of a difference between systems.", "I still disagree. If i want to make, say, a level 9 wizard, I know I get some level 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 spells, and 5 feats. To choose those spells, I just pick them from the lists of those spells. I don't have to worry about which stats they are based off of, or which particular random quirks I might have in my wizard path or paragon path.\n\nA level 15 Fighter in 4e must choose which of his stats to major in. He has to choose a paragon path from a decent list of them, and then choose 8 feats and a class style. He must then choose powers from many different levels, and retrain some of those in paragon tier, as well as retrain feats to paragon tier ones.", "I mostly hate that some people in my group refused to play anything other than 4e after it came out, meaning many a great campaign had to get scrapped or rebooted.", "[Psh.

The best buy for a newbie to 4e is probably the [Red Box](https://www.wizards.com/dnd/redbox.aspx), which is the equivalent to Pathfinder's Beginner Box.\n* Warrior, Rogue, &amp; Mage is an excellent system that provides much of the same fantasy atmosphere as D&amp;D but with a rulebook that's about 40 pages instead of a few hundred pages like D&amp;D 4e and Pathfinder. The whole thing is [freely available](http://www.stargazergames.eu/games/warrior-rogue-mage/), and all you need is the Core Rulebook: this includes information on building and playing characters, how to run the system as Dungeon Master, and all necessary rules.\n* Fate is a universal system (you can have fantasy, sci-fi, modern, or whatever type of game you want). It's available [here](http://www.evilhat.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=79&amp;products_id=224) as a pay-what-you-like download. Fate focuses on being accessible to newbies and promoting an interesting story rather than realistic simulation or tactical thinking.\n* Open d6 is essentially one simple RPG system available as [three](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/20446/D6-Adventure?src=s_pi&amp;it=1) [different](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/20448/D6-Fantasy?it=1) [rulebooks](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/20447/D6-Space?src=s_pi&amp;it=1) depending on what genre you want to play.\n* [GURPS](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/) is a somewhat complex but very open-ended universal system that can work for pretty much every genre you can imagine.\n* [Call of Cthulhu](http://catalog.chaosium.com/product_info.php?CDpath=29&amp;products_id=359) is an excellently-made horror RPG with a moderate rules system (much simpler than PF or D&amp;D 4e, but still more complex than WR&amp;M or Fate). Whereas in D&amp;D 4e kicking down doors and hitting anything that moves with a sharp object is pretty much the norm, CoC provides a very different experience where the players frantically try to figure out what's going on (often at the cost of slowly going insane) and avoid a fight at all costs.\n\nThe /r/rpg Beginner's Guide [here](https://pay.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/beginnersguide) can also help out a lot, and /r/rpg and /r/dnd are usually friendly to newbies.", "Holy crap your NADs are abysmal.

It's a bit daunting.", "1st or 2nd Edition have the best \"roleplay\" aspect. 3rd and above is where they started to realize WoW was really popular and tried transitioning into number-crunch power-gaming centered more and more on combat than exploration and story telling.", "There are a few editions to consider:\n\n* 1st Edition: A rather rules-light system where making up house rules to deal with situations the rules don't talk about was expected. Combat in particular is much simpler (but arguably more cumbersome, since it involves consulting tables rather than just asking 'did my die roll at least X' like in other editions) than in later editions. It's also much more lethal; there's a significant chance a player will die in pretty much any fight. 1e is being reprinted and you might be able to find a copy in a hobby store and/or on Ebay.\n* 2nd Edition: Similar to 1e, but with smoother and more connected non-combat rules and a greater ability to customize characters (your melee warrior guy can be a paladin, fighter, or a ranger instead of just 'warrior' like in 1e). 1e and 2e are very similar editions overall. 2e is also being reprinted and if you're lucky a hobby store will have it; otherwise you might be able to find it on Ebay.\n* 3rd Edition: Like 3.5 Edition, but slightly worse.\n* 3.5 Edition: Slightly updated version of 3.0, and rather different than 1e or 2e. There's a huge amount of customization, lots of skills even in non-combat situations, tons of possible classes and races, and an enormous variety of spells and magic items. 3.5 is the go-to edition if you want lots of options. On the other hand, 3.5 has some problems with balance, especially at high levels (past about 10th level spellcasting classes are usually just flat-out better than non-spellcasters). There are a lot of 'save or suck' effects, where a single poor roll can kill or permanently screw over a character. One other complaint about 3.5 is 'dead levels', when your character increases in level but gets few if any actual bonuses. The rules can also be rather clunky and complex. For a beginner, I would strongly recommend Pathfinder over 3.5.\n* Pathfinder: Not published by the same company as D&amp;D, but essentially a newer, updated version of 3.5. The [Beginner Box](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox) is specifically made for newbies to RPGs, and PF fixes a lot of 3.5's problems. There are few if any 'dead levels', class archetypes provide the same variety as 3.5 without having to search through vast lists of 'prestige classes', better (but still worse than most other editions) balance between classes, and it's simpler for the Dungeon Master to create encounters.\n* 4th Edition: *Enormously* different than any other edition. Instead of each class functioning differently (wizards cast spells, and rogues use sneak attacks, and monks have their own abilities, etc.), each class uses 'powers', which are different for each class but work using the same mechanic. This means that all classes have unique abilities (your fighter can do more than just say 'I hit things with my sword'), but can also make it feel like all classes are just minor variants of each other. There's no 'dead level' problem as with 3.5, balance is almost perfect, and it's much easier for the Dungeon Master to create encounters. On the other hand, combat is much more tactical even than in 3.5/Pathfinder, and many groups find that this discourages roleplaying. 4e has a [Red Box](https://www.wizards.com/dnd/redbox.aspx) for newbies similar to the Pathfinder Beginner's Box.\n* 5th Edition: Still under development, so it's probably best to stay away as a newbie.\n\nTL;DR: 1e is simple, 2e is halfway between 1e and Pathfinder, Pathfinder has lots of options, and 4e has balance between classes. Also Pathfinder and 4e are the easiest to find these days.", "This is great, thanks a lot. 2e sounds like the one.", "I love the older style D&amp;D PC games that basically were just computer versions of the paper game.

", "I had been trying to get my friends into Pathfinder for a long time but I could never do it because of the stigma behind D&amp;D. So for the past 12 month's, while on disability for brain surgery, I developed a game using Pathfinder. It's a sci fi game, replacing classes and races with what you would find in a space sci fi. Cleric becomes medic, rogue becomes scout, elf becomes alien, etc etc. I also made a completely original universe with custom maps, enemies and characters. I also changed a lot if skills, weapons, feats, enemies, pretty much overhauling everything to fit my theme while still keeping a lot what makes pathfinder... Well... Pathfinder. I used RPGmaptools to create everything and even hired semi professional voice actors to play out my campaign.\n\nAnyways, fast forward to about a month ago. After numerous retools and changes, I finally decided to debut the game to my friends. I told them nothing about it. I didn't tell them it was D&amp;D, I didn't tell them it was a tabletop game, nothing.\n\nTHEY HAD A BLAST. When I finally told them that it was \"D&amp;D\", they were amazed. We've played about 3 games since. It would have been more, but I'm still developing the game and need the time. Dm'ing is time consuming.\n\nMy point is, I love D&amp;D but have always hated the stigma it has developed. Heck, my friends wouldn't even try it.

[Here is this article](http://carltonbale.com/does-4k-resolution-matter/) on why 4k TV sets are impractical (at least in a living room setting) due to the required screen size at a typical seating distance to even be able to see a *resolution* difference.  Even Sony documentation on their own 4k sets recommends an *extremely* close viewing distance to be able to see the difference.  \n\n[This from gadgetwise] pretty much saying the same thing, with verification from the ISF (Imaging Science Foundation).  Computer monitor-wise 4k will be amazing, but in a living room setting it is far from the miraculous increase many expect, unless you plan on sitting 4ft from your TV (assuming around a 60\" screen).  For 8k, you are looking at 2ft for a 60\" screen.  [Another distance calculator here](http://referencehometheater.com/2013/commentary/4k-calculator/).  \n \nOne of the big things that 4k can bring that is exciting is xvYCC extended color space.  Much more accurate color representation, which the ISF rates 3rd in its list of most important features for picture quality, behind dynamic range and color saturation.  Screen resolution was fifth.  Of course, we would need a method to actually get xvYCC video playback, but that is another matter.....ugh\n\nOf course resolution is certainly important in this sub, as is refresh rate, but I see these so often used only as selling points in living room TVs and are very very misunderstood.  They think they are going to get their new 50\" 4kTV home and be blown away by the pictures.  They very well may be, but they could have done the same with a 50\" 1080 - unless of course they like sitting 3 feet from a 50\" screen. ..\n", "Yeah we are getting in Seiki's by the truckload where I work for our super-duper cheap Black Friday sales and they look like complete ass compared to the Sony's, Samsungs, LGs, and even Sanyo's.

Lighting, Models, Texture, and Resolution.\n\nLighting; All the HD Textures, high poly models, and massive resolutions in the world will look like crap if they are drawn with a flat full material shade lighting. You need things to cast shadows, you need the objects to be brighter on the side that faces light and darker on the sides that don't. The more realistic you can make this the better; things like post rendering effects, bloom, HDR, Dynamic shadows, bump mapping... all contribute.\n\nNext you've got models. Remember the original Tomb-raider, ol' Pyramid-tits? No matter what resolution you're running at, high definition textures you've set up, awesome lighting effects you've created - all of that will be for naught if she's doesn't have a protruding nose, hair that moves on it's own, all the little nuances to make multiple different parts move. As well as occlude the environment behind them appropriate to the shape the model is trying to convey.\n\nThen you've got textures, what you paint onto models and light with your lighting systems. If you're stuck with an 8 bit colour scheme, and 16 pixel by 16 pixel textures, you're going to find it difficult to really draw in the surface details. You simply can't capture the different shades of hair colour or show individual strands of hair if you don't have the colour pallet and texture size to draw it in. \n\nLastly is your viewpoint resolution. All that other stuff could be phenomenal, but if you're stuck at a 400x300 resolution, it's going to look pixelated. \n\nSo, while, some people would have you think that you're only as strong as the weakest link in any of these scenarios - I don't think that's entirely true. You take a game like Unreal Tournament which was built to scale really well; the textures were never given a full HD Remake, but running it at 1920x1200 still looks better than 800x600, or 1024x768  or 1280x1024. It's just not as good as it COULD look if the textures were updated. And even if those textures were updated, it could look a lot better if the models were updated... and if those were updated, it could still use some lighting improvements. Its more that the weakest link is always the most apparent - not so much that things can't be improved even while certain parts are lacking. ", "Don't forget increasing shader complexity.

If the medic dies team is usually screwed, often hides behind other pieces and stays close to avoid flanks and charges.\n\nDemo for queen has high mobility, highest dps output in the game.\n\nScouts for knights slipping behind enemy lines quickly with jumps and speed\n\nSoldiers for bishops jumping behind enemy lines from angles pyros as well for flanking heavy rooks\n\nHeavy for rooks powerful but weak to being flanked also usually castles medic to protect him\n", "Thinkin' the same thing!", "&gt; Medic - Queen (most important class, you're in trouble if you lose him)\n\nOn further thought, this makes a surprising amount of sense - whilst the Queen is important on the offense, you probably don't want to be throwing it into the thick of the action where it might be vulnerable. Better off kept in a support role, using all the directions it can move in to protect as many other pieces as you can.\n\nThat line of support sounds a little like a medbeam to me...\n\nMedic + Engi/Sniper doesn't really translate well to the strategy of a Queen backing up a Rook down a vertical line, maybe make Sniper a bishop (good at picking things off even when they're at a distance and behind cover, by slipping diagonally through a line of pawns) and Pyro a Rook (tends to run in straight lines but if he comes smashing through your front line you notice pretty quickly, especially when reinforced by a Queen/Medic)", "I think the tops of the pieces might be interchangeable to allow you to choose which pieces they are. RED's is totally different from BLU's.", "That was giving me heart palpitations until I read the comments and saw that you could interchange them.", "If you look closely you can see that you can screw off their hats and put it on any other piece, so you can easily have even a scout for queen.

I don’t even know where he found this chess set, probably on the street, it has a distinct yard sale look. It’s one of those crystal chess sets, or fake crystal, whatever, but you know, the kind popularized by the first X-Men movie, when Professor X is playing chess with Magneto, but because he controls metal, he’s in a plastic cell, and everything’s made out of clear plastic.\n\nThat was like the go-to Christmas present for everybody’s dad across the country that Christmas. “Look dad! I got you a present!” and the dad’s like, “Gee … thanks son … it’s a chess set. Thanks.” And the kid is so oblivious, so pumped about how cool it looks, he can’t tell his dad’s blatant lack of enthusiasm, “You want to play dad?” and what’s the dad going to say, no? It’s Christmas. “All right, set it up, let’s do it.”\n\nOne game of chess, one painfully slow game of chess, during course of which, I’m sure even junior realized his total lack of chess abilities, that just because you know what each piece does doesn’t mean you know how to play. Ten minutes later, the pieces are back in the box. Ten minutes after that, the set is lodged permanently underneath the coffee table, where it sat unused, for years, for over a decade, and that kid doesn’t even live here anymore, he never came back after he left for college.\n\n“Let’s have a yard sale!” from the mom turns into, “Look what I got for only five bucks!” from my friend Bill, and he looked so happy, jeez, he’s not an unhappy guy or anything, but it’s rare to see him this happy, and so I’m scratching my head, “Sure man, set it up, let me know when you’re ready to go.”\n\nAnd chess, Jesus, I’ve read articles about chess, how the pros spend so much time looking at previous games and mastering moves thought out seven turns ahead, that it’s not even about an individual piece, they’re playing patterns, brainwaves are working at a level that would take me probably the rest of my lifetime to dedicate just to learn how to think that way.\n\nI remember one night while I was in Ecuador, the power went out and, for lack of anything else to do, I spent ten or fifteen minutes just staring at my Internet-less laptop screen, going through the hollow motions of pointing and clicking and opening up folders and there I found it, the built-in chess app. I said to myself, I know how to play chess, I was in the chess club.\n\nYes, I was in the chess club, but so was everybody else in my school. We had this rule, you had to belong to at least two extracurricular activities every year, and the two default clubs that required practically zero effort whatsoever were chess club and social studies club. Social studies club is a whole different page of crazy, but it more or less amounted to an extra social studies class once a week after school, sitting in a desk and listening to the crazy old social studies teacher get lost in tangents about when the UK and the USA were finally going to merge into the United States of the North Atlantic. Insane stuff.\n\nBut he made us sit there the whole time. At least the chess club moderator let us put our names on the sign up sheet before chess club started. So it was basically sign up, sit around and pretend to play chess for a while, and then leave. Chess club.\n\nI wondered if Bill was in chess club also, and he confirmed it, not in anything he said, but by his opening move, he took the castle right from the back and jumped over the front row of pawns. Whatever, I really didn’t feel like prolonging the agony, so I let it slide. The game would have been cool if we at least had those timers, the cool things the pros slam down on when they’re done taking their turns, but we didn’t have anything.\n\nAnd as we each started accumulated pieces, our attitudes turned surprisingly competitive. No, I don’t think either of us were exactly following the rules, I mean, I didn’t jump any pawns, but I did execute a very questionable castling maneuver, like I know it’s possible, but I just kept assuring Bill, “No, it’s totally legal. That’s exactly how it’s done,” and finally we got down to just two kings, his and mine, pointlessly circling each other around the board.\n\n“What do you say Bill, call it a draw?” and he smiled, “Sure, if you want to forfeit, we can stop playing.”\n\nOf course I wanted to stop playing, these were some of the most boring minutes I had spent all week. But forfeit? To Bill? I would have been hearing about it for years. This guy doesn’t let anything go, the most trivial successes have a way of echoing down the ages, I could see it now, he’d be over my house years from now visiting my family around Christmastime. He’d see the chess set my son bought for me, and he’d throw in, “You know, I used to beat your dad in chess all the time when we were roommates.”\n\nBullshit. “No way Bill, it’s either a draw, or we keep playing.”\n\nAnd that’s been it. I feel like I’m being fair here, I’m not demanding Bill gives up. Why is he being so stubborn? Isn’t this boring for him too?

Person with longest road wins probably 60-70% of the time, largest army 25-35% of the time, nothing 10-15%\n\nAlthough it ultimately depends on your starting location and most of the time the person with the best starting positions wins.\n\nThe game is pretty devoid of actual strategy though; often coming down to which dice rolls are hot that game.\n\nStill a lot of fun to play, however.", "You must not play with other ruthless people.

A lot of people build too many roads and aren't mature enough to wait multiple turns saving up for stuff that is more important.

It can hit pretty bad, but 90% of the time things are fairly even with the dice.", "Well I do play with some ruthless people. The problem with Catan however, is that halfway through the game you have 2 people who have a shot at winning and 2 people who pretty much are out of it, which takes a lot of the ruthlessness out of it for the two losers (maybe the 2 player expansion helps with this?).\n\nBut I mean, you have to build at least one road before you can even build your third town, so one more (road) isn't really gonna hurt (especially if you have good brick/wood spots to start - and the better tile is one more road away). Once you have 3 towns then its time to start connecting them/blocking/building to ports/going for longest road.\n\nNot really sure how anything I said conflicts with anything you said :/ Not like I said GO FOR ROAD RIGHT AWAY FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE!

Use it or lose it.\n\n&gt;Basically, if you build two roads before you build a third settlement, you're probably going to lose 95% of the time.\n\nNah, like I said, often times it's better to wait a little bit longer early game to secure the much better tile spread with the extra length of road then it is to jump the gun and settle in a bad spot.", "I love seeing everybody's strategies, and each person says \"this one is the best\"\n\nIn my personal opinion, I think the best strategy in the game is \"Be Flexible\".  Never have a plan that takes too long to execute.  If you have a plan, it's going to get ruined by the time you get there.\n\nWhat i'm really trying to say is... Every strategy is the best strategy.  I've won with longest roads on heavy brick+wood.  I've won with just a cluster of settlements upgraded to cities (focus on wheat+ore).  I've won with development cards (which pretty much automatically encompasses largest army).  There's so many ways to win, and they are all great strategies, and that's why this game is so freaking awesome.  But like you said earlier, it really comes down to dice rolls.

A lot of resources were extremely hard to come by - almost nobody ever had bricks.  I had sheep.\n\nThen I got a trade route.  I could make bricks, and people wanted my bricks.  I invested by putting cities around my sheep.  Suddenly I had a massive influx of sheep.  I turned them into everything I needed to add a settlement, then turn it and another into cities.  I won entirely on sheep.", "In the Vanilla game, Ore and Wheat are king of all. If you can get at least one city on a good Ore/wheat spot, you've got the game in the bag. \n\nHere's the facts:\n\n * You spend resources to gain victory points. \n\n * The only two ways to increase your resource income are to build more settlements and upgrade to cities. \n\n * In order to build a settlement, you need access to 4 of the 5 materials.\n\n * In order to upgrade a city, you only need access to 2.\n\n * **It's not possible to win the game without any ore.** You can build 5 cities, get longest road, but in order to gain any of the other point methods, victory point cards, armies, cities, you need Ore. There's the 4:1 trading method to get it, and sea ports, but that applies to every other card as well.\n\nHow does this all break down in a real game? It's simple; you get a decent roll, and say you play against people who don't know this strategy: You place yourself in a pretty good position to get Ore. If everyone knows and uses this strategy, the game is pretty much decided by dice role.\n\nFirst thing you do is upgrade your settlements to cities to increase your resource income. Once you've got ore and/or wheat coming in at a good rate, use the 4:1 trading to get sheep or use these resources to acquire sheep from opponents; as they tend to be considered more valuable than sheep (which are only useful for settlements and development cards).\n\nNext, never stop buying development cards. It's your turn, you've got enough for a development card? Buy it. You will inevitably get largest army, since knights take up most of the deck, you'll no doubt get more than a few. Hang on to them, and only use them if your opponents put the thief on your income. \n\nYou might come across a victory point card. Score. \n\nIf you get year of plenty, use that to get wood and brick, enough to build a road, so you can build a settlement thereafter. \n\nIf you get monopoly, hang on to it until you see a buildup of whatever resource happen. 2 of the last 3 rolls have resulted in 2 people getting brick, that's your time to call in all the brick. Same goes for wood, or Sheep. \n\nUse trading at 4:1 or with other players to get the resources you need to build that settlement.  Upgrade that to a city at your first chance. \n\nBy that mid game point you should have 3 cities, 6 Victory points. If you've been playing your cards right, you should also have at least 1 victory point development card, because there are a few. If not, you should be well ahead of your opponents, and they'll think their 4 settlements + longest road idea is better than your condensed 3 cities plan. \n\nThen you start using your armies you've acquired non-stop, you'll probably have 4 or 5. Even if its not impacting you, you use it to steal from other players. Keep track of who gets what, so you have the best chance at stealing what you need. You can either go and buy more development cards, or try and invest in another settlement. \n\nYour 3 cities + largest army gives you 8 points, at which the final 2 points are easily acquired by either expanding and dropping settlements wherever (even on the desert if need be), roadbuilding development card will make this easy, or you obtain the victory point cards and just flip them over.\n\nIt's OP.

PC games can scale very low, and some still require a 8800gt, which I think was released in 2007. Also, I've heard of you needing a specific OS to play a game, but I never heard of a game outright telling you that you can not play due to low specs, but if you have such low specs that you can't even start a game (assuming it's not the games fault), then you may want to upgrade\n\n(I know you stated that much of what you said is hyperbole)\n\n&gt; You just put the goddamn disc in, hit start, and enjoy.

So as a result, instead of focusing on last-hitting which you will inevitably lose, you try to force him to be unable to deny your farm by harrassing him back. \n\nNow if this were league of legends, because players cannot deny each other's farm, instead of having a dynamic battle based on the strengths of each laner, it is simply a fight of harassing (or staying alive) while also not missing last-hits.

Your only doing to be making money as long as you have a popular game with millions of active users. However as you mentioned,  the barrier for entry to the market is low,  and quality standards aren't on the same level as triple A development studios. So,  any small Development studio can in theory pop out a game like Zyngas top titles with a good bit of effort, and if they do it well, and make a top quality product, they can swipe all those people from Zyngas userbase.

[This article by a Gearbox dev](http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/community/articles/1061) has a good explanation of how this works.  I tested on Fallout New Vegas since I didn't have Skyrim installed and NV is on an older version of the same engine.  I think one of my mods was conflicting with the command and resetting my FoV when I exited the console, so some of these screens have a chunk of white text on them.  [Normal](http://i.imgur.com/cnYOUz9.jpg) [FoV](http://i.imgur.com/SeDbw8a.jpg) for refernce.  setting [FoV](http://i.imgur.com/KSFZI1a.jpg) to [360](http://i.imgur.com/hScO1oZ.jpg) only seems to go up to 180 degrees at a guess.  There's a big red building behind me that would be visible if the actual FoV was anywhere near that angle.  Most likely the engine checks to see if the value being entered is valid prior to attempting it in this case.  This is not always true in other games though.  I accidentally performed this same experiment in Minecraft a while ago, and setting FoV too high with a speed potion just flips the camera upside down and backwards like the player's neck has been snapped.  Resizing the window, however, results in the [typical](http://i.imgur.com/NknE2.jpg) [light](http://i.imgur.com/IGuyT.jpg) [speed](http://i.imgur.com/UmpRd.jpg) effect.  Games that don't have an inbuilt way to adjust FoV can be manually changed via a tool such as [Widescreen Fixer](https://www.widescreenfixer.org/), but tend to crash a lot as a result.  High FoV can also mess up hud elements and make things appear in the wrong place.", "That information is incorrect- FOV of 180 and above are mathematically impossible with a rectangular projection.

This means that you cannot warp the view as in [PanQuake](http://strlen.com/gfxengine/panquake/) or [FishEye Quake](http://strlen.com/gfxengine/fisheyequake/).  I do not know if things like the Oculus Rift could drive a change to rasterizers, as the rift would benefit from hardware that can do non-linear edges.  Currently, games that are sent to the Rift have the image distorted after it's been rendered, losing detail and wasting processing power.\n\n-Render the scene multiple times at different viewpoints.  If you only have one monitor (or a number of monitors in a plane), stitch the images together.  If, on the other hand, you have multiple monitors surrounding you, send each render to its respective monitor.  This can produce accurate 360 degree imagery, and is used for things like flight simulators.\n\nI am very frustrated that the latter option is so very rare in games.  Virtually everyone with three monitors tilts the outer ones at an angle relative to the central monitor.  But because the scene isn't rendered three times for each viewpoint, *you are getting a completely incorrect image*.

I mean, becoming a god and then being able to kill one, just, awesome. I have never felt so immersed in a game before or since.", "For me, I think it's that Morrowind is more of an \"alien\" landscape with creatures I'd never seen or heard of (With the exception of Bloodmoon - I wasn't all that thrilled with that expansion), which made it easier to get engrossed in Morrowind. Oblivion and Skyrim are more \"traditional\" fantasy settings, and while I like both of them, I just don't get sucked in as much as I did with Morrowind. \n\nI suspect the fast travel in Oblivion and Skyrim is also part of this. When you're forced to trek through the wilderness to the next stilt strider and experience everything that's on the way, it's a lot easier to appreciate the depth and complexity than when you're just like \"Oh, I'll fast travel here, kill this thing, fast travel back\" blah blah blah.", "I am not sure how much the alien landscape helped the immersion, but it was definitely interesting. \n\nBut you are so right on the Fast Travel. At first, it is not a big deal, but when you get to a point where you can more really quickly around the map and encounter almost nothing along the way it does break the immersion a bit - skyrim especially after about half way into the guild quests you are sort of just zooming around the map a lot, not actually feeling part of the world.", "I think for me the alien landscape helped with immersion just because I've played a ton of games set in more traditional fantasy settings, but Morrowind was unique, and that helped me to get engrossed in the world without comparing it to other games in similar settings, since there are no games that were in similar settings.", "The world of Morrowind had a deep and rich soul. It didn't feel empty. You started as a weak prisoner and had the potential to become a God.\n\nI know it's corny, but Morrowind had an exciting aura of adventure about it.\n\nOblivion and Skyrim (while decent games in their own right) just didn't have the same feel. It was as though they were missing a crucial element. They felt fake.\n\nI couldn't immerse myself in them in the same manner I could with Morrowind. I didn't feel weak, I didn't feel like a pitiful being and I didn't feel like a God.\n\nI think it's a cross between story writing and game development.\n\nUnfortunately the current market (generally) sacrifices story for 'streamlined' gameplay. Which equates to a lowest common denominator effect on new titles being dumbed down in both their story telling and game play execution.\n\nBut we know that already.", "I mean, it's kind of interesting, all three games have you starting weak and as a prisoner of one kind or another. It's an elder scrolls thing. But I would love for someone to really explain why Morrowind is so much more immersive. I mean, yes there is that God bit, but it was just the way the whole thing was structured felt unique, wheras Oblivion, and to lesser extent Skyrim, failed to hide that basic mechanic of \"go over there, kill/fetch something, come back\". Maybe I was just younger, but after about the 50th mushroom covered stone dungeon in Skyrim, I was getting really bored. I mean, the dungeons like the ancient temples or the sanctuary made it worth it to keep exploring, but still. ", "Well, it helped immensely that Morrowind didn't transparently scale the content to your level.  Despite being a weak prisoner at the start of Oblivion and Skyrim, you never *feel* weak because the world changes to accommodate your weakness.

I doubt it will ever get tiring.\n\nI think I described this game well enough to my friend: So, you start off, and you play a little. You discover two towns and then restart. Repeat about 5+ times.

Tessellation, Ambient Occlusion, Anti-Aliasing, and Shaders have *vastly* improved in recent years. It's one of the only benefits of the stagnation of resolution in the last 5-7 years. Developers were able to work on physics and superficial improvements much more, resulting is good looking effects - they just don't scale well at this point. 4k is going to take a lot longer than you think to be effective. You're going to be running games on medium that your computer can run on ultra today. Unless we're ok with the whole consoles are the standard thing, we're going to be downgrading our graphics with 4k to meet the hardware needs. Basically - really high resolution textures, but console quality shadows and such.", "Fair point, and you get an upvote. Resolution did stagnate in the past 5-7 years, but there were hardly any displays that made 1080 seem obsolete. 4K really seems to be the future, and more hardware and games are supporting these resolutions.", "Games already support 4k. The issue isn't whether they support it. Let me put into into perspective for you:\n\n1080p is standard. Games run at 60fps. 3 years pass. The resolution hasn't changed, but hardware is still improving, so shadows and such got better and better. Games look better(textures are still the same, which can be noticable). Now, say we were to suddenly jump up to 4k. Now all these awesome improvements to game effects are going to be completely raped by literally quadrupling resolution. We were already min-maxing our hardware, and now the goal is to have those effects work on a quadrupled resolution? Not going to happen any time soon.\n\nOne of two options happens (more than likely the latter). We spend years waiting for hardware to catch up and still use 1080p, or we nerf the shit out of graphics and move to 4k as planned in the next few years (consoles will reign supreme in this regard, and we'll end up with a similar effect we've had in the last few years, games stagnating graphically for a while).", "I don't agree and here's why, but your arguments deserve another upvote. \n\nWe already have top-end hardware today running 4K with the best effects. It is strictly limited to the the high end spectrum, though. However, we already see top-end hardware of yesteryear be supplanted by today's mid-end hardware (such as the GTX 580 and GTX 660 Ti). An extreme example is the Samaritan demo. It took 3 580's to render the scene, but only took one 680 to do the same. This rapid cycle of increasing performance will allow mid-end hardware in 2-4 years to be capable of 4K rendering without sacrificing graphical fidelity.", "I guess I should rephrase. The issue currently is that consumer devices (eg. PCs that aren't $3k+) aren't capable to doing it effectively. The top of the line games, running at just 2560x1600 and such, require 2x$1000 graphics cards to play maxed out (eg. Metro Last Light). I don't consider that to be reasonable from a consumer's perspective.\n\nYou're also EXTREMELY underestimating how much of an impact resolution has.

A ps4 will cost me $649 NZ, + the tv (or I could use the monitor I have to my pc). To me it is completely non-comparable for performance vs price. \n\nWith anti-aliasing I don't even find the high res necessary past a certain point. \n\nThe design and artist skill is the bottleneck at this point. I'm not saying Battlefield 4 isn't pretty, it is, but it's simply competent. The textures are high res and the lighting is great. You get a game like Last of Us or Portal 2 or Bioshock Infinite, and the design cuts through the fidelity to make a truly beautiful game. Hell, you even see indie games like Hyperlight Drifter which are essentially pixel art, but the craftsmanship and the animation is what makes it still look amazing. \n\nEDIT: Just before anyone from the US starts telling me I got ripped off, it was a built PC, with medium high level components (nowhere near top of the range).
