If there was evidence that male circumcision truly effective sexual performance or enjoyment in the way that female genital mutilation does, then there would be justification for banning the practice.  There is no such evidence, and therefore it is wrong to ban this innocuous procedure that is an important part of many people's culture.

Children can't make informed decisions about a number of things, so we leave the decision to the parents. Even when children have the ability to reason and use logic parents are still legal guardians in the U.S. and therefore have a right to make that decision. Vaccinations, Flu Shots, Dietary concerns, schooling, church attendance etc etc are all left to the parents regardless of a child's decision or ability to voice his/her opinion. Yes, some may view circumcision as genital mutilation, but forcing that opinion onto other who do not share that opinion is a slippery slope.

In fact, there are many options: no circumcision; infant circumcision; childhood circumcision; adult circumcision.  Regardless of whether you circumcise a baby boy or not, you are foreclosing choices.  If you do circumcise, you foreclose the no circumcision choice.  If you don't circumcise you foreclose the option of infant circumcision.

If someone values the options as follows: 1 infant circumcision; 2 no circumcision; 3 adulthood circumcision, prohibiting infant circumcision eliminates that person's most preferred option on the basis that they didn't get to actively choose it.  I disagree with doing that.  It is impossible to preserve all three options for a child.  You must pick the first and make the latter two impossible (not that anyone would pick 3 over 1) or pick the second and make the first impossible.  Given the inherent restrictions, I think the best option is to let the parents decide for each infant whether they think infant circumcision is best.\n\nI don't see how one could claim that there is no \"sound medical reason\" for infant circumcision when the AMA concluded the opposite (so did the Canadian health authority - I don't remember what they are called).  Just so you don't feel compelled to paste it all here, I'm familiar with the articles that anti-circumcision people post on reddit all the time trying to make a medical case against circumcision.

In fact, from 2011 data, it appears that the likelihood of contracting hiv in the United States was about 0.01% from the real infection rates.\n\nSource : http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/basics/\n\nOn the other hand, circumcision isn't as harmless as you suggest,\n\n&gt; Significant acute complications happen rarely, occurring in about 1 in 500 newborn procedures in the United States.\n\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision\n\nThat's a higher risk of complications (0.20%) than the risks you suggest circumcision addresses. Even if you are trying to make a numbers argument, the numbers don't back you up.\n\nWould you think a cultural norm of performing single mastectomies on people without their consent to prevent breast cancer would be a good idea? That would actually save lives.\n\nEven if the foreskin serves no useful purpose, it's wrong to perform what is essentially a cosmetic surgery to someone without their consent, regardless of age, gender or body part.", "The source that gives the numbers that you discuss (about the probability of complications) also clearly states that the benefits out weigh the possible risks. This is because any analysis cannot simply look at the overall risk of contracting HIV vs. complications; contracting HIV (or HPV/other infections) and having acute complications (as an infant) are not equivalent.\n\nAlso, the chance of contracting HIV must be looked at without regard for the relationship status in order to compare it to the risk of complications. \n\nYou also fail to mention that circumcision has other benefits aside from reducing the risk of HIV infection. Circumcision essentially eliminates all risks for phimosis, balanoposthitis, and the most common penile infections (such as yeast infections). Therefore it is extremely obvious that, no matter how you view circumcision, it is absurd to view it as a purely cosmetic surgery.\n\nBut obviously, for the most part, if a circumcision is to take place, it should be a neonatal circumcision performed by a properly trained medical professional, as the risk of complications increases with the age of the patient.", "If we're playing numbers here, how much does circumcision reduce the chances of getting HIV, because they clearly don't reduce it to 0, so you can't act as if circumcision immediately eliminates that chance. So when you talk about the numbers, you have to remember that not only does it come with a higher risk of complication than catching the disease in the first place, it only marginally reduces the chances of infection marginally at best. \n\nI'd rather hear what a not for profit medical community has to say about the topic, since there is also a clear conflict of interest coming from the American medical community. ", "See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision_and_HIV \n\nI have never said it eliminates the risk, and have only noted that there is a decreased risk (since the exact percentage decrease varies). You are probably referring to the fact that circumcision eliminates the risk of certain conditions which require foreskin (just like an appendectomy eliminates the risk of certain conditions that require an appendix). \n\nAlso, a simple preventative procedure is less valuable to a for-profit medical community than continued or increased risk of infection. So if anything, the evil for-profit medical community would want people to avoid circumcision. There have been several studies that have concluded it costs less to be circumcised than to be uncircumcised.", "There has? I'd love to see them, and the way in which they were able to determine that having a foreskin equates to more medical attention being required for the average person living in North America, as I call complete bullshit on that. ", "Ok... Well, if you think about it, if you're at a higher risk for certain infections and have several more conditions that can affect you (ones that require foreskin) then there is a higher chance of you needing medical care than someone without those things. That isn't really a big step in thinking... And since medical treatment requires some form of payment, there's some cost associated with that higher risk... And if that cost is higher than the cost of getting a circumcision, than obviously it makes more economic sense to get one...\n\nAlso, there was a link to one in another comment on this exact article... \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1qglt1/norway_to_introduce_new_regulations_on/cdcsnmz\n\nSo you can call bullshit on pretty basic logical thinking all you want, it's not going to change anything.\n\n", "It doesn't say anything about cost effectiveness except where HIV is concerned. \n1. The estimates on HIV come from studies in Africa, which in no way resembles anything in North America. So as far as I'm concerned are moot at best. Second, those studies are also further extremely flawed in any form of scientific testing. Unless they took circumcised and uncircumcised men, had both groups have sex with the same HIV infected woman under the same conditions, and observed the results, that study holds little if any anecdotal evidence on the reduction of risk to HIV. There's far too many uncontrolled variables involved in those studies for it to be anything more than a curiosity, rather than a fact. If this is the kind of science you base opinions on, you may as well save yourself the time and flip a coin instead. \n\n2. There is no mention if they took the costs of complications as a result of circumcision into account. \n\n3. The cost of curing these infections that result from having a foreskin is minimal. The average American is likely to spend more money over a few years on anti - depressants than they are over their lifetime on treatment for foreskin related infections. None of they practice even semi - decent hygiene. \n\nI get that you have your mind made up on the issue and that's fine, however spreading misinformation and garbage studies so a legitimate reason and evidence to support you is just irresponsible for people looking to make an actual informed decision on the matter. ", "Ok... You clearly didn't actually read anything. I'll summarize. The Cost-Effectiveness study is summarized under a headline that reads **Cost-Effectiveness and Ethical Issues for Neonatal Circumcision in the United States**. It goes on to state that both studies were conducting within the United States. So, clearly, it does resemble North America (being data from the United States, which is in North America not Africa, in case you forgot).\n\nAlso, there are two studies, one for HIV prevention cost-effectiveness and one for general illness (including HIV, UTI, penile cancer, balanoposthitis, and phimosis). Both conclude that circumcision is cost-effective, for general health and HIV prevention. \n\nAlso, that isn't how science works. This isn't a study on HIV transmission for specific sexual behavior (as you seem to think), nor is it about the likeliness of contracting HIV from a specific HIV infected patient. This study is about the cost-effectiveness of circumcision for the general population, for average sexual behavior with average people. The biological effectiveness is calculated by comparing the rate of infection from the circumcised group to the other. Because both groups will have similar average behavior. The cost effectiveness is determined if the average cost of a circumcision was less than the average increase in cost of medical care for those without.\n\nThe uncontrolled variables you speak of are the same variables that exist in the average persons daily life and are relatively the same across both groups (they are all Americans and have access to the same things), so they are not uncontrolled they are simply part of the environment.\n\nThis is the kind of science I base my opinions on, actual science.\n\nIf you follow the link, the summary and its sources are linked. This has nothing to do with the overall cost compared to other medicines or conditions, this is the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of circumcision compared to that of the lack of circumcision - nothing more.\n\nAlso, this is a CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in case you were wondering) study - so it clearly comes from a respected source. I don't have my mind up, the evidence for the merits of circumcision is just very clear. You shouldn't be making up a bunch of stuff about an article you didn't read. That is far worse than me linking a CDC page detailing information that is very important in making an informed decision.", "The medical concerns you list also have non-surgical treatment options. I don't disagree that it can be a preventative treatment for a number of common medical concerns, but with the non-surgical treatments that exist, I don't see it as a compelling argument. \n\nIn a vacuum with no other medical treatment options, it's possibly a worthwhile procedure, but with condoms, communicating with your partner your medical status, regular STD testing, modern hygiene and antibiotics, the need for a surgical solution is practically non-existent.\n\nIf there were no other treatment options, it would be a more complicated issue, but these are all either entirely treatable or preventable without non-consensual surgery.", "Ok... It doesn't particularly matter whether you view it as a compelling argument or not, there are some that do, such as a large portion of the american medical community.\n\nYes, there are other treatments and other ways to obtain certain benefits that would otherwise be obtained through a neonatal circumcision - but those other treatments and practices cost time, money, and thought that circumcised men do not need to waste on otherwise fully preventable conditions. \n\nIf there were no other treatment options, it wouldn't be a more complicated issue - it would be an issue with a blatantly obvious answer. Since there are other treatment options it becomes a choice for the new parents. Do they want their child to possibly have to address certain relatively minor problems and be at a higher risk for certain major problems, or do they want to prevent these things with a surgery that has a very small risk of complications and no real quantifiable adverse effects later in life. To me, it's pretty understandable why many find this argument convincing.", "&gt; Ok...

Be seeing you.", "Haha. Yes, obviously any current medical practices should be under constant scrutiny - and believe me circumcision is continually studied (as evidenced by the sources your links contained). But the problem is that these studies have consistently returned inconclusive results or concluded that the benefits out way the risks. Your fight against the practice of circumcision is not the same thing as fighting the practice of lobotomy - it's more akin to fighting the practice of vaccination.\n\nAlso, to be clear, I didn't say that your opinion doesn't matter - I just said that it doesn't matter if you find the argument compelling.

The cost of postneonatal circumcision was 10-fold the cost of neonatal circumcision63. There are also studies showing very marginal cost-effectiveness.\n\n&gt;A 2010 study estimated that newborn circumcision reduces a U.S. male’s lifetime risk of HIV acquisition through heterosexual contact by 15.7% overall, by 20.9% for black males, 12.3% for Hispanic males, and 7.9% for white males. In this model, the number of circumcisions needed to prevent one case of HIV was 298 for all males and ranged from 65 for black males to 1,231 for white males.

Totally professional and insightful. Amazing. So much great knowledge:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/DD2yW7AaZFw\n\nKen McGrath, Senior Lecturer in Pathology at the Faculty of Health, Auckland University of Technology and Member of the New Zealand Institute of Medical Laboratory Scientists discusses his research into the neural anatomy of the human penis and the physical damages caused by circumcision.\n\nMcGrath is author of The Frenular Delta: A New Preputial Structure published in Understanding Circumcision: A Multi-Disciplinary Approach to a Multi-Dimensional Problem, Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Genital Integrity: Safeguarding Fundamental Human Rights in the 21st Century, held December 7-9, 2000, in Sydney Australia.\n\nAbstract: Textbooks and papers referring to penile function state that the source of penile sensation is solely the glans and often justify the existence of the prepuce by stating it protects the 'sensitive' glans. These statements are contrary to the neuro-anatomical and physiological facts accumulated over more than a century. This study reviews the findings of Taylor, et al., that the prepuce is the primary sensory platform of the penis, and describes a new preputial structure.\n\nThis interview was taped in Berkeley, California 2010.\n\n...and from the Global Survey of Circumcision Harm\n\nhttp://www.circumcisionharm.org/\n\nRemoval of the male foreskin and the female clitoral hood (female foreskin) are anatomically equivalent. \n\nHowever, neurologically speaking, removal of the male foreskin is as destructive to male sexual sensory experience as removal of the clitoris is for females. This video discussion of penile and foreskin neurology explains why. \n\nContrary to popular Western myth, many circumcised women do report the ability to feel sexual pleasure and to have orgasm, albeit in a compensatory manner that differs from intact women [suggested reading: Prisoners of Ritual by Hanny Lightfoot-Klein]. Similar compensatory behaviours for achieving orgasm are at work among circumcised men, who must rely on the remaining 50% or less of their penile nerve endings. \n\nJust as clitoridectomized girls grow up not knowing the levels of pleasure they could have experienced had they been left intact, so too are men circumcised in infancy unaware of the pleasure they could have experienced had they not had 50% of their penile skin removed. The above video also explains what's really behind the erroneous comment made by some circumcised men that they 'couldn't stand being any more sensitive'..\n\nHere's how the penis and the clitoris both develop separately from the genital tuber:\n\nhttp://www.baby2see.com/gender/external_genitals.html\n\nThe male foreskin and female clitoral hood are anatomically equivalent, but \"equivalent\" is an everyday way of explaining it. The proper term is \"homology\".\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)\n\n*\"In the context of sexual differentiation—the process of development of the differences between males and females from an undifferentiated fertilized egg—the male and female organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue. A typical example is the ovaries of female humans and the testicles of male humans\"*\n\nSo the clitoris and penis may be said to be \"homologous\"; and the same can be said of the foreskin and clitoral hood. But that does not mean they have the same function or scale. For instance, the male foreskin in a adult is around 13 to 15 square inches in size; whilst the female clitoral hood is much, much smaller.\n\nAlso, please do remember that the clitoris is a very large organ, most of which is *internal* to the female.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoris\n\nThe visible part - the glans clitoris - is only a small part of the whole clitoris. So when a woman suffers partial or total amputation of the external clitoris when undergoing the crime of FGM, only a small part of her clitoris is removed.\n\nYou can read a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of the foreskin here. This relies on research in the British Journal of Urology:\n\nhttp://www.moralogous.com/page/2/\n\nForeskin Sexual Function/Circumcision Sexual Dysfunction\n\nhttp://www.cirp.org/library/sex_function/\n\nBritish Journal of Urology:\n\nFine-touch pressure thresholds in the adult penis\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x/full\n\nMale circumcision decreases penile sensitivity as measured in a large cohort\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2013.11794.x/abstract\n\n**Conclusion:** What is the most sensitive part of the external genitalia of the male?: The foreskin with it's 22,000 nerve endings. What is the most sensitive part of the external genitalia of the female? The glans clitoris, with it's 8,000 nerve endings. \n\nHence Ken McGrath's conclusion: *\"neurologically speaking, removal of the male foreskin is as destructive to male sexual sensory experience as removal of the clitoris is for females.\"*\n\nIn order to understand this subject fully, you need a complete and comprehensive dissemination of the structure, function and  anatomy of the male and female genitalia and the associated medical and scientific research in these matters.\n", "Whoa.

Middle-high class people in Spain (like me, we have 4 panels) were installing solar panels with a huge discount (they were heavily subsidized for years) which brings electricity costs up for poor people. It is a big problem in Spain, the situation is that rich people are saving money and getting richer while poor people have to pay more in electricity because the grid has to be maintained and somebody's gotta pay for it. Poor people cannot afford the installation even with the subsidies, they cannot afford to make the investment.\n\nMy family is going to disconnect the panels, it's an inconvenience and a better fix could have been found I guess, but I totally understand the reasoning for the move, as solar energy is just increasing inequality. Please note that grid energy is expensive in Spain to start with, for a variety of geopolitical circumstances. Btw I'm selling some panels, can ship to Europe.\n\nI know there are probably details about the law that are fucked up, cause our political class isn't too bright, but this is not nearly as retarded as it sounds once you know the social context.\n\nAnd by the way you are not gonna find many Spaniards on the internet who bring you this perspective, because the subset of the population which could not afford the panels and for whom the electricity bill is a big deal is not the same subset that can speak English. There's a huge amount of middle class hypocrisy and entitlement on the net in Spanish surrounding this issue, personally I find it disgusting. By the way, I can assure you almost nobody gives a fuck about the environment, getting some panels as an investment that starts paying off in 2 years (solar energy works great in Spain for obvious reasons) was becoming a hallmark of Spanish middle/high class, if you saw panels in somebody's roof or backyard you knew they were very well off.\n\n**EDIT:** Since I came back to find this post had a ton of upvotes, gonna clear another fact that these articles are making up, the ridiculous millionaire fines. The formula for the fine is the following, and I've looked this up because it affects me:\n\n- The fine is between 100% and 300% of the money that the solar panel owner would have saved thanks to the unreported solar panels, up to a maximum of EUR 18,000.\n\nThe figure of 60 million (or similar, it varies) traces back (I think) to Forbes and is nowhere in the law. As far as I can tell Forbes got the figure from some South American newspaper. Maybe Forbes read the amount in that south american country's currency instead of euros and they didn't convert. I'll research it later and try to find the origin of the confusion if I have time, but the formula is definitely the one given above.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Ok let's break down the origin of the bullshit figures.\n\nThe first newspaper to report the millionaire figures that Forbes brought to international attention seems to be Costa Rican ElPais on Jul 21 2013:\nhttp://elpais.cr/frontend/noticia_detalle/6/83700\n\nTheir source is the Spanish blog KaosEnLaRed (**K**haos in the net) from Jul 21 2013.

It's ironic that in a more recent article they have a FAQ in which they clarify that those fines are a myth, when as far as I can tell they started the rumours.\n\n&gt; ¿Me pueden multar con 30 millones de euros por instalar un kit solar de autoconsumo de 250W? NO, la sanción que nos pueden imponer por no comunicar que hemos instalado un kit solar de autoconsumo corresponde al triple del beneficio bruto obtenido. \n\nTranslated:\n\n&gt; Can I be fined EUR 30 millions for installing a self-consumption solar kit of 250W? No, the sanction that they can impose on us for not communicating that we have installed an self-consumption solar kit is three times the net profit obtained.\n\nNow, I have a theory about where this person could have gotten the 30 millions figure. An EUR is 168 pesetas (extinct Spanish currency from before the Euro).\n\n18,000 EUR = 3,024,000 pesetas\n\nSome Spanish people, specially old people had a hard time adapting to the currency change and they have to mentally translate everything to pesetas, specially large amounts, to really understand how much money they are talking about. I'm thinking somebody in Spain just did a bad conversion (added an extra 0), then they spoke with the blog author without mentioning the currency and that's where the blog author got the 30 million figure.", "It'd probably be better to find another way of paying for the grid (straight out of income tax, for instance), instead of disencentivizing renewable energy.", "Aren't there also ways to take any excess energy from renewable resources and return it to the grid? \n\nIf the electric companies can purchase that from private individuals at a lower cost, they could provide energy to poorer families for a lower cost.

For starters, the vast majority of Spaniards live in apartment complexes instead of houses, so the option of installing panels is not there to start with. Then, there are two types of panels: some that only heat your household water and some that generate and store energy. The latter type does not generate savings, but earnings instead, because most people don't use that electricity for their household: they sell it to the electric company for a higher price than they pay to buy the energy they need from that same company. This is because years ago a law was passed that mandated power companies to buy \"green\" energy from any citizen that offered to sell it, at a very high fixed price. Of course, electric companies are not happy with this law, and this is where this law comes into action: by taxing green energy producers for their use of the grid, you disincentive citizens to produce and sell their power to the power companies. So power companies are not forced to buy overpriced energy from citizens, are happy again and hook our politicians with nice high-paying jobs. \n\nAs for why didn't banks give loans left and right for people to buy panels? The thing is, they did. Getting some land and filling it with panels was a big business some years ago. Only, it was companies doing it instead of people, because most people didn't have the stretches of land needed to really make it profitable. I don't know where does OP get the idea that they pay for themselves in 2 years, but unless you have lots and lots of panels (and I mean, oh so many more than you can fit on top of a single house) so they make lots and lots of profit, they most certainly don't. For reference, 3 years ago I looked into it and the estimate I was given for an installation that could supply power for a 100m2 household of 2 people was 30k€. My total power bill for the last year was 600€*, so no, it doesn't pay for itself.\n\n*It's low-ish.

And not only did they have to buy it at a significant markup, they also lose opportunity to sell an equal amount of their own generated power.\n\nBut instead of simply going back on their contract, and fixing the tariffs they come up with this hair-brained tax that affects all solar power, including those that installed an appropriate amount and simply offsets their household usage: ie, how residential solar power should be done today.\n\nThe bill is an overreach, the utility companies don't just want to fix the situation, or recoup their money, they want blood, so they push their a bill that effectively ends solar power in Spain.

In referencing the millions of other Chinese children who do not have lung cancer, I am highlighting the statistical insignificance of this particular case. If air pollution is the single definitive cause of this child's case of lung cancer, should we not have already seen a dramatic increase in the incidence/prevalence of lung cancer within all urban populations subject to the same environmental risk factor? \n\nCancers deriving from environmental factors rather than germ line mutations are unusual in this age group.

You may be surprised at what they would say about pollution in their own country.  Many first world countries today that are considered environmentally very clean - just a few decades ago - had *worse* pollution than China today.  Without good data from that period, of course it's hard to prove this and it's mostly anecdotal...

And with no press freedom they probably have limited ability bring focus to the problem in the media, and bring about real change.\n\nToo many people in China are suffering tremendously for their economic progress. Without democracy I think it will be very hard to do something profound about this.\n\nI think it also highlights the problem when people become obsessed with GDP growth numbers without considering having a balanced growth.

Many of these goods require energy.  In China, that energy is coming from coal.  Coal is not clean.  It can be cleaned up some, but that has a cost that energy producers are generally not willing to pay.  China wants its economy to grow so that people can have more.\n\nThe reliance on industry in China is not helping.  Industry uses energy and creates more pollution.  That television that you are watching and iPad that you are using did not come from nothing.  That plastic jar you keep your cookies in had to be produced.\n\nIdeally, facilities that are inefficient or causing pollution should be shuttered or at least cleaned up.  This not happening though.  State companies ignore pollution laws because they can.  Provincial government will ignore laws because they need the companies to exist.  Operating companies provide tax moneys.\n\nWhat China ends up with is a subsidy to industry.  People are paying in terms of their health and the environment.  The polluting facilities are thus able to help fuel Chinese growth.\n\nedit: this is also an example of externalizing costs.  The US and Europe are able to externalize the pollution costs of manufacturing by moving it to someplace else.  There would be less pollution in the US or Europe (due to more efficient methods of production of goods and energy, along with less acceptance of giving up one's health for growth), but it would still have a cost that would have to be paid by the people of those places.

Westboro Baptists are extremist...they are a minute, infinitesimally small percentage of the population...countries filled to the brim with shithead Muslims aren't an extremist minority...sorry.  As far as I'm aware, the Westboro baptists don't have a whole geographical region that they control that they can practice their hate and deliver it onto the population...meanwhile Islam has the Middle East, where they can freely practice misogyny, racism, and any other bigotry that they deem necessary.

Is the right assault a protected right under Brittish law, or just Sharia law?\n\nSo far as I'm aware, gender discrimination and honor killings were against Brittish law.  But again, maybe I'm wrong here too.\n\nBut why try to stop it, its just their culture, right?  Why try to stop the acid attacks?  The honor killings?  The gender inequality?  Its just their culture right?\n\nSo, because only a limited segment of whites were lynching blacks in the early 1900s USA, should we have turned a blind eye to it, or not made steps to ensure that these types of crimes weren't happening?  With your reasoning, there is no reason that we should have classified the KKK as a hate group or had tabs kept on it because they are just exercising their opinions, right?\n\nAnd you are right, it is stupid people doing stupid things, but don't try to act like they aren't the majority of the religion.  The moderates are actually the outliers in this case.  When you have the majority of the countries in the ME politics shaped by Sharia law, then its obviously a political issue as well.  Some countries, like Denmark, are already taking political measures to ensure that these types of things don't continue to happen.\n\nAnd I never had a point to make about people thinking differently.  They, and you, are welcome to whatever idiotic notions or ideals you want to define your life with.  But you can't force that lifestyle on others, thats the issue.  If some stupid asshole doesn't want to drink, or doesn't think that women should have rights as menial as being able to drive, he/she is fine to hold that stupid, skewed belief system. \n\nBut when you want to apply that same system to everyone else, or attempt to, with the threat of murder or violence, then it becomes an issue.  Doesn't matter if its 200K people that feel that way, or if only ten do.  As soon as they take it upon themselves to harm others or coerce others through violence to adhere to their religious beliefs, they are in the wrong and they need to be stopped.  And because we aren't just dealing with one isolated incident, but rather many, and they all seem to have the common denominator of \"radical\" islam, I'd say that there is a strong political case to be made that some measures need to be taken.\n\nIf I wanted to immigrate to the US, and I held the same beliefs as these morons such as a woman's testimony against her rapist can only be heard if it is corroborated by four Muslim males, and the interviewer asked me this and I actually gave an honest answer, I can see why someone may not want me in their country...because I'm a stupid, religious bigot...just like these guys are.  \n\nPeople can cry discrimination and xenophobia, but its only a case of the former.  Because as you look more and more into Islam and how Islamic states are run, you'd have to be a Islamic bigot or an ignorant dipshit to not see it for the obvious social disease that it is.

So you can see 25kWh of battery is ~$10K\n\nZoe is cheaper so you lease it\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Zoe#Production_version\n\n&gt; In France the Zoe pricing starts at €20,700(US$27,250) before applying the existing €7,000 (US$9,200) tax incentive, plus a monthly fee for the battery. The cost of leasing the battery for 36 months starts from €79/month (US$104/month) for an annual distance travelled of 12,500 km (7,800 mi) and includes comprehensive breakdown assistance\n\nSo you're paying $18K for a car and getting a 22kWh battery.\n\nOn the upside the fact you're leasing means you get a new one as it wears out.

It's about $10k for 8 years, or $1250 per year or $104 per month for Tesla. Or $104 per month for Zoe. With Tesla you pay up front. With Zoe you pay per month and they can disable the car if you stop paying.\n\nIf you look at the Zoe it is much cheaper in terms of sticker price compared to a Tesla. You could turn up with $18K and drive away a Zoe in France. With a Tesla you're looking at $62-$72K less subsidy (which is $7-15K in the US).

And it looks like they're not making a lot of money off that, it's simply to cater their market.\n\nAnd honestly, one can't complain to have his battery blocked from other manufacturers when he chose to not pay upfront.

One way it could work is for the car to refuse to work unless the battery identifies itself with a digital signature signed by Renault.  A converter socket could plug into the same place as the battery, but would need to present an ID signed by Renault, which Renault would not do, as their goal is to force people to buy batteries only from them.\n\nThis all relies on the car having Renault's public key to verify the signatures.  It might be possible to add a new public key to the car, or to replace Renault's with Acme Battery Converter Socket Co's, or even to modify the car's firmware to not check signatures presented by connecting devices at all.\n\nBut there are obstacles to the above, not least of which is that the workarounds I just described can be decalred illegal \"circumvention devices\" under the DMCA in the US.\n\nPrinter manufacturers tried this same move; just replace 'car and battery' with 'printer and ink cartridge'.

The changes reached the plants in 2008 and if I'm not mistaken it cost a bunch of plant execs their jobs. They tightened quality assurance, changed manufacturing routines, opted for new suppliers and tweaked their design process to tackle the reliability problems. This has helped immensely and they're fighting an uphill battle to win back the public's trust. Sadly, they're quite inept at getting the message out and an old and bitter dealership network isn't exactly helping but they're moving in the right direction.

If you read the opening page of the passport, it states that the only authority it grants is a *request* by the Sovereign (the Queen) to grant you passage into another land - foreign lands are free to refuse your entry.\n\nSo, being government property, they can set the rules.  We in the west don't like to think of passports this way, but this is their function.  The denial of travel documents is certainly akin to receiving an exit visa in the Iron Curtain days, but there is nothing strictly illegal about the move.\n\nBeing a citizen, the UK government only has to allow you to travel within the UK, not anywhere else.  If a foreign land wants to admit you without a passport, you are free to leave, but there is absolutely no *right* to a passport.\n\nNow, in terms of revoking citizenship (the second point) this is going to be much more difficult/impossible for the government.  Certainly the government has the right to revoke citizenship of dual-citizens, but under the U.N. declaration the government cannot make a person stateless.\n\nWhere this gets complex is that the rules of citizenship are not universal in application.  For example, many countries automatically revoke your citizenship if you gain citizenship of another country.  As such, you could be born in country X, then naturalize in the UK.  The UK may see you as a dual citizen, but country X may not - thus the UK may think they are within their rights to revoke your UK citizenship, but it would defacto make you stateless - which is illegal.\n\nThe government is going to run into considerable difficulty trying to revoke citizenships.", "What would be the effect of being stateless?

Indeed, the resolution of the war (with both a Nicaraguan invasion in the North and Americans staging in the Canal Zone in the offing) is most plainly linked to the diplomacy of the conservative president. Figueres by no means had a clear mandate after the fact despite being technically in charge, and the power flip-flops meant that there were a a lot of competing if overall \"social welfare-oriented\" views injected into government programs in the 50s and 60s.  \n\nThat replacement of the factual with the dramatic continues through the piece.

They were able to generate traction for these reforms because state run industries and banks were easy targets; they were poorly run and deeply corrupt. \n\nSomewhere in the middle of that is a useful conversation about striking a balance between state-run, protectionist initiatives, a safety net, and the promotion of free enterprise within that framework.

During Pol Pot’s reign, Chomsky disputed the refugees themselves. Since Cambodia, he has expanded his game to North Korea and Bosnia. I must hand it to him – more than three decades after wagging his finger at refugees like myself in “Distortions at fourth hand” The Nation, 6 June 1977, and later in After the Cataclysm South End Press, 1979, he continues to quote selectively and to obfuscate. Chomsky’s formula is straightforward: 1 quote a critic saying something supportive of one little piece of an argument you wish to make; 2 needle other critics with it; and 3 repeat ad infinitum until you weave an entire tapestry with this flimsy thread. It is a game that only a linguist of Chomsky’s calibre can master.\n&gt; I am merely a former Cambodian refugee, for whom English is my fourth language. Yet it does not take much effort to find precisely what Chomsky wrote in 1979 After the Cataclysm and to let it speak for itself:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; “In the first place, is it proper to attribute deaths from malnutrition and disease to Cambodian authorities?”\n&gt;\n&gt; Since my father died of malnutrition and disease, I am especially outraged by this question. While my family worked and died in rice fields, Chomsky sharpened his theories and amended his arguments while seated in his armchair in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I believe that he would probably have me blame the Americans and their bombs for causing everything around the Khmer Rouge to go wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; Incredibly, Chomsky and Ed Herman did precisely that when they claimed:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; “If a serious study… is someday undertaken, it may well be discovered… that the Khmer Rouge programmes elicited a positive response… because they dealt with fundamental problems rooted in the feudal past and exacerbated by the imperial system.… Such a study, however, has yet to be undertaken.”\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps that study had already been undertaken but was ignored, as Chomsky and Herman intimate: “The situation in Phnom Penh resulting from the US war is graphically described in a carefully-documented study by Hildebrand and Porter that has been almost totally ignored by the press.” This is high praise for a book that contained a propaganda picture of a Khmer Rouge “hospital” operating room.\n&gt;\n&gt; It just so happens that my father died in a mite-infested Khmer Rouge “hospital”. Nam Mon, an illiterate Khmer Rouge “nurse”, testified in July 2009 at the Khmer Rouge tribunal now taking place in Phnom Penh that all she did was hand out paracetamol and aspirin, no matter the malady. To be sure, her patients got the special treatment; they were prisoners at S-21, the Khmer Rouge killing machine that produced more than 17,000 deaths.\n&gt;\n&gt; When it comes to allowing for honest error, Chomsky will have none of it. He refers for example to Father Ponchaud’s differing American and British editions of Cambodia: Year Zero as evidence of duplicity. If he had cared to check with the easily accessible French priest, he would have learned that the error was due to his translator, who submitted the wrong edition to the publisher.\n&gt;\n&gt; Writing about American leaders in At War with Asia (Pantheon, 1970), Chomsky poignantly argued that:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; “Perhaps someday they will acknowledge their ‘honest errors’ in their memoirs, speaking of the burdens of world leadership and the tragic irony of history. Their victims, the peasants of Indochina, will write no memoirs and will be forgotten. They will join the countless millions of earlier victims of tyrants and oppressors.”\n&gt;\n&gt; Indeed, perhaps someday Chomsky will acknowledge his “honest errors” in his memoirs, speaking of the burdens of academia and the tragic irony of history. His victims, the peasants of Indochina, will write no memoirs and will be forgotten. They will be joined by his North Korean and Bosnian victims.\n&gt;\n&gt; For decades, Chomsky has vilified his critics as only a world class linguist can. However, for me and the surviving members of my family, questions about life under the Khmer Rouge are not intellectual parlour games. While he is a legend in linguistics, in international affairs Noam Chomsky consistently falls short of Thomas Jefferson’s maxim that universities are “based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.”\n", "It's a good thing they don't execute people for eating foreign food, Big Macs, because otherwise they'd have to shoot up the great pork ball in office.", "If its anything like almost everywhere else, the elite have different laws.
