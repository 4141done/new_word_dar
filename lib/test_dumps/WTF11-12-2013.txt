Caffeine is a lovely stimulant that makes many people very happy while doing a minimal amount of damage to the human body. No big deal, right? Get your caffeine fix! More power to ya!\n\nNow, let's say that for decades, the only way to get your caffeine fix was by drinking energy drinks. Not only are they chock-full of sugar and artificiality, and loads of other stuff, the energy drink companies are purposefully adding extra stuff to them. This other stuff increases your dependence on energy drinks. However, the side effects of these add-ons are...well...basically cancer and death and stuff. And these things apply not just to yourself, but to anyone that you drink around. Plus, energy drinks make your breath and clothes and hair stink.\n\nNow you're stuck. You've become pretty addicted to caffeine. In fact, if you try to go without it, you go through awful withdrawals--shaking, sweating, hurting, lashing out, etc, etc, etc. Your will-power crumbles and you crack open another energy drink. You'll quit next week. One more week won't kill you. You'll do it soon. You'll be fine.\n\nHark!! What's this?!?!? A new caffeine product???? It's in drink form, so the habit of raising something to your lips and drinking is satisfied. Check. It contains an appropriate amount of caffeine, so your caffeine habit is satisfied. Check. It comes in literally hundreds of flavors, instead of the 4 basic energy drink flavors. Which means, it tastes much better. Check. It does NOT contain any of the harmful or addictive additives that the energy drink companies put into their products. Which means that the risks to your health now come 99% from the caffeine, instead of the package it's delivered in. And, studies seem to indicate that just caffeine isn't so bad. It doesn't come with the all-but-guaranteed cancer and death and stuff. \n\nSo, now you have a question to answer. Do you keep trying (and probably failing) to give up energy drinks?

He went to the ER, where the doctor told him he was getting old, and to take it easy and get some aspirin for his joint pain. The guy died of a massive heart attack the next day.\n\nThe plaintiff's lawyer made it a case of the doctor simply wanting to go home and rushing the guy out of the ER without giving him a proper examination.

For backstory, I feel like I may have had a very similar situation to OP's picture when I broke my arm a few years ago:\n\n\nFractured my radius, about 2\" from the wrist, displaced about 14mm (imagine your wrist twisting inwards but the rest of your arm doesn't) which caused some nerve damage. The surgeon decided not to use pins (I had them put me under and was only 17, leaving the decision for/against surgery to the doc and my parents) and just set it and cast it. Turns out they underestimated the swelling that accompanies severing most of the nerves to your hand and they had to cut the original cast off and redo it to accommodate my inflated appendage.\n\n\nFast-forward 2 weeks to my first follow-up and another re-cast after all the swelling had gone down, and the x-ray reveals that my arm had displaced about 10mm again. Doc explains why he opted against surgery (no surgery=less risk of infection, and wouldn't disturb the nerves as they heal) and admits that he made the wrong call. Luckily, after only 2 weeks the break was still soft enough that they could re-set it without too much effort, but this time they put two pins in my arm to hold it in place. \n\n\nAfter I got the \"pins\" I could see why just setting it in a cast was a much more recommendable option than having two large nails sticking out of your arm for 8 weeks. I'm kind of amazed that it never got infected, 17yo me was not the most... sanitary person.\n\n\nAnyways, the point is that there is always an informed decision in a case like this, but sometimes medical professionals do make the \"wrong\" recommendation. After all, nobody can be 100% right all the time. It's still super shitty to have to have a bone re-broken due to something like this, but sometimes that's just the way she goes.", "Thanks for your personal input.

You can get all sorts of nasty infections, dead bone, clots, nerve and tissue injury etc.", "A lot of people underestimate 1) the inherent, acute, risks of surgery (as in anesthesia and bleeding related issues)  and 2) the risk of not only infection, but drug resistant infection. 1) can be mitigated by skilled surgical teams, however, 2) is a much more complex issue, as much of the time the infection is contracted post-surgery.", "&gt; sometimes medical professionals do make the \"wrong\" recommendation\n\nThis is true but it doesn't mean that it was the wrong recommendation in your case.

Went to emergency and they put it in a cast. I wast told to follow up with my doctor so I did, right away, and he was a pretty sharp and thoughtful doctor so he insisted I go to a specialist. \n\nThe specialist immediately told me that my kind of \"break\" did not necessitate a cast. In fact, if I had kept it in a cast I would have ended up with an arm that wouldn't stretch out all the way. So you can imagine what my physical therapy was--Stretch my arm out as much as possible. It hurt like a damn mother fudger but I did as he instructed and my arm is for all intents and purposes great.\n\nMoral of story: Always get it checked out by a specialist after your initial consultation and follow your therapy plan!\n", "You can barely notice....", "I'm truly amazed and terrified by the amount of incompetence in the medical field. \n\n", "http://m.imgur.com/a/6wNT3\n\nSame thing happened to my pinky.

I broke my left elbow in the growth plate at age 3 and the doctor (Dr. Wong of Wichita Falls, TX to be exact) placed it in a cast without setting it. The bone rotated and fused back together leaving my left arm severely crooked. He kept promising that it would straighten out and of course, he lied. I had to wait 9 years until I was 12 to have corrective surgery where they broke my elbow again and placed pins in it for weeks in order to reset and straighten it out. \n\nTo this day I wish we would have sued the doc who fucked my shit up because as I get older (I am 25 now) I experience more pain and problems with it. My parents didn't think it was the \"Christian thing to do\" at the time considering I was admitted into the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital in Dallas for my case and had all expenses for the corrective surgery and appointments taken care of. They did an amazing job but my arm still remains crooked and will never be the same. \n\nI am sorry this has happened to you. I strongly suggest you take legal action now before it is too late (as in my case) so you can at least get something out of the damage. I think to myself often what would have happened if my parents had decided to sue because after some research I found that Dr. Wong has had more than one case of malpractice under his belt in my hometown. \n\nBest of luck to you!

Its also something automakers thought of decades ago and thats why you will only find it possible in old cars or third world countries. [\"As a way of protecting us from ourselves, automakers design a function called Reverse Inhibit into transmissions to prevent inadvertent selection of reverse. \"Putting it into reverse [in modern cars] when going forward has no action at all, the car just ignores the request until you get down to a proper speed,\" said Renneker\"](http://autos.aol.com/article/reverse-transmission/)\n\n&gt;A wasp once flew in my truck on the highway and my knee hit the column shifter. Knocked it up from Drive into Reverse at 55mph. Luckily I pulled it back down before the gears could mesh.\nThis could potentially happen with a console shifter too.\n\nHave you ever driven a vehicle, do you have a license?", "The only thing stopping the actual shift lever from being put into reverse is often a small actuated pin in the shift column. Those pins wear over time, so older vehicles are more prone to 'allowing' it.\n\n(similar systems are often used in stick shifts; not just for reverse, but also to prevent accidentally shifting into low gears over a certain rev range)\n\nOnce that lever is in position, though, it all comes down to the car for what happens next. In vehicles with electronically controlled transmissions, the system won't shift down until it determines it's safe to do so... either via the VSS, transmission RPM, wheel speed, accellerometer measure, or what have you. It varies by system.\n\nUnfortunately, electronically controlled transmissions, while near universal on new cars, aren't as prevalent on older cars. And while some (but not all) older cars had systems in place at the transmission level, designed to prevent damage, these systems were often little more complex than the pin interlocks on the shifters themselves. And just as prone to wear failure. Which tends to happen from use and age.\n\nBy older, I mean as new as early 2000-2004'ish, which is extremely common in my economically depressed region. 90's models are also common. Especially when talking about pickups, where resiliency combined with cap-ex limits finds these vehicles staying on the road a long time, as work trucks and then cheap, utilitarian family vehicles.\n\nAs a personal anecdote, my mid-90's Geo (Corolla) thankfully still has the shifter pin lock still (mostly) intact, but I did manage to throw it into reverse from about 20mph one time, and the transmission made a wrenching squeal before throwing itself into gear and stalling the engine.^* It happens.\n\n^* I'd just come off a week driving my mother's 5-speed manual. That car had a leak in the clutch cylinder, which caused the clutch to not entirely disengage when shifting. The result was having to jam the clutch down fully, and then shove the stick into gear... forcefully. I'd just come back from a 5-hour drive in *that* car, when I had to drive another few miles in mine. As I was leaving my sister's neighborhood, I instinctively went to make the shift from second into third, slamming my left foot onto the clutch, and slapping the shifter into second. Only the clutch was actually the side of my brake pedal, and the shifter clunked solidly past the retaining pin into 'R', and a bad time was had by all. Although, in probability, had I not slammed the brakes, it might have been a worse time.\n\nP.S.: My father is a mechanic, and I've done my fair share repair work before, which is why I'm fairly confident all this is accurate. These systems aren't that complex, but they're also not that robust.", "What the hell man? That is so much text, dude just take an upvote and I hope what you said was right.", "**TL;DR**: Reverse Inhibits are often flimsy, especially on older (pre-2005-ish) cars, which are more likely to act funny because age *anyway*.
