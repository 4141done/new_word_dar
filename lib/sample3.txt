I miss the "Hide Annotations" button. One click, and all the annoying annotations were gone. Now I have to go into a menu. It's dumb.
edit: It's been pointed out that you can go into Settings -> Playback and uncheck the Annotations option to turn annotations off permanently. Which is beautiful. Here's hoping it sticks and they don't "helpfully" make me do it again!
edit 2: Apparently it won't stick if you have things like cookies turn off. Crap. Foiled again.

My mother's glass top stove. It has touch sensitive control buttons on the cooking surface, which means that if you have a spill or something boils over, you can't turn the stove off
permalinkreportgive goldreply
[–]Pinstar 1924 points 13 hours ago
Our stove has a cleaning cycle that locks the oven door while it is on and has a temperature sensor to keep the door locked until it has cooled down to a safe temperature. All that is normal.
The problem comes that you cannot cancel the cleaning cycle once it is active. So if one puts in some food and accidentally hits the cleaning cycle button instead of bake, it locks and is hell-bent on turning your food into charcoal. The one time we derped and hit the wrong thing we ended up going to the basement and throwing the circuit breaker to kill power to it. Thank goodness it was an electric model.

If it was a gas model, I suspect shutting the gas off would have the same effect. Until they invent a nuclear stove with a self contained reactor, you'll be able to turn it off.

One of the toilets at work cracked, so plumbers came in and replaced all the toilets. They replaced long bowl toilets with those tiny teacup bowl toilets. Someone managed to squirt feces all over the back of the seat because he couldn't fit on the tiny seat.
The small bowls were promptly exchanged for long bowl toilets.

I work for a company that builds fancy, expensive electronics things. On a few designs, the positive and negative voltage cable ports are right next to each other on a certain circuit board. Plugging them in the wrong way blows the board and costs the company thousands a pop. Should the connectors be keyed so they can't be plugged in wrong? No, that's too complicated. How about color coding the wires? It's cheaper to just use white wire for both.
So here we are, wasting thousands on test, rework, and reassembly on a problem that's fixed by spending an extra $5 on the initial assembly.

Type up a report explaining the flaws and explaining how to fix it
One of two things will happen. The higher ups will see your good work and it could open up opportunities. Or you're wrong for some reason but you still made an effort to make the company better and they'll like the effort
Edit: Y'all motherfuckers are way too negative. Yes something could go wrong. Something can always go wrong. A comet can strike us tomorrow, I can get into a bad accident on my way home, I can even have a heart attack before I finish typing this. But I would be damned if I didn't take every opportunity to further myself.
OP do it in a correct manner. Don't go around your direct superior, that is only going to create bad blood, but don't just sit back because then further down the line someone might take your idea and present and they'll get your rightful promotion.
PS: I didn't have a heart attack.

The paper towel dispensers that require you to pull hard on the towel to overcome the spring and get the towel out. Whoever designed that must not have realized their main audience is people with wet hands.
permalinkreportgive goldreply
[–]iamkokonutz 1959 points 9 hours ago*
Hey. That's me... I'm the guy who designed this dispenser, and many others like it.
This is actually an electronic version of the handsfree dispensers, but same principle.
So, a lot of times, when the dispenser isn't working properly, it isn't a dispenser issue, it's a paper or janitor issue. We designed this specific dispenser for a customer. That customer gives the dispenser to the company using it for free, in exchange, they lock them in to a paper contract, so they have to buy the paper from the company who gave them the dispenser.
The company who gave the dispenser away builds the price of the dispenser into the price of the paper, so if the company using it, switched to another brand to save money, the company who gave it away and installed it for free loses.
So, we designed the dispenser in such a way, that it locks out other brands of paper. This means, it is designed to put massive friction on the paper roll if the proper roll isn't purchased from the company who gives away the dispenser for free. It's called a lockout mechanism and it ensures the company who bought it from us, gets a return on their investment.
Unfortunately, the end user with wet hands doesn't see what is going on inside the dispenser, they just know that they get tiny little pieces of paper instead of full sheets. It sucks that we needed to punish the end user for the transgression of the building who is trying to cheat the system, but it's the only way to be alerted to the fact that they are trying to cheat the system. People complain, the building manager calls the paper company, they send out a rep, the rep looks, sees they have violated their contract and forces them to either buy the proper paper, or they pull the dispensers off the wall.
EDIT to add more reasons why the dispensers don't work properly.
Sometimes, the dispensers are mounted to an uneven surface, which torques the base. That causes the rotating drum to be out of alignment and have friction. Any amount of friction when using paper as the belt that drives the engine is obviously bad. Mix in wet hands, and you get little tabs or paper in your hands. They need to be mounted flat against the wall. (What I mean by this, is I've seen dispensers mounted with half the plate for the light switch under the base. The unit was so torqued, you could barely get the lid to open or close.)
Paper unrolling inside the cabinet causes quite a bit of paper dust to accumulate inside the dispenser. We designed the dispenser to deal with the dust, and designed flow channels to keep it from accumulating in the moving portions of the dispenser. However, some janitors will try to clean out the dust, and spray window cleaners and stuff inside the cabinet. This causes a very sticky, paper mache that can gum up the internal mechanism. Really, just use air or a rag if you're a janitor, not water and def not cleaning products
Also, with the lockout mechanism, sometimes the paper company who makes us put that into the dispenser can't hold their own tolerances and make out of spec paper. The company using the paper hasn't broken the contract, but the paper is so large, or too short and it activates the lockout mech. If the dispenser works, works work, then stops, it's probably the roll is out of spec. Should be fixed with the next time it's refilled.
EDIT #2 GOLD! Paper towels baby! Ticket to gold! Thanks to that person!

This reminds me of something actually, similarly related I guess because it's designed to hold water.
My Mother once purchased drink bottles for me and my 2 brothers, because we were all going to Gyms and we kept mixing up our drink bottles at home. She came back with solid aluminum drink bottles that have suck tops. Making it basically impossible to get any decent amount of water out of the bottle because the bottle wont compress if you squeeze it with your hands.

Irish sinks are like baths as opposed to showers. You're supposed to plug the drain with that thing on the chain and then let both the hot and cold water run (more hot water if you want warmer, more cold if you want cooler water) to balance out and give you the right temperature for you to submerge your hands into. I hope this makes sense.

Time to finally tell this!
Dallas World Aquarium had the shittiest toucan cages ever.
In third grade, I went on a trip to the Dallas World Aquarium. Beautiful place. Tons of awesome fish, sharks, and motherfucking penguins. However, there was one exhibit that was particular fascinating to me: the toucans. Why? Because the cages were overhead.
My mom (a chaperone) pointed and said, "Reggie, look at that toucan!" I looked up in excitement and, at that very moment, one large blob of toucan shit landed in my eye.
I guess the architects didn't take the fact that toucan shit is affected by gravity into mind when placing the cages above the visitors.

I had a small, cool looking green portable radio I got for free at Kohl's that had the same knob for volume and tuning. Turn it left, the channel advances in increments of 0.05 Hz, turn it right and the volume increases. You couldn't turn either back. Ever. You had to pull out the battery to reset the volume and channel. Miss your channel? Fuck you. If a particularly loud ad or song came in and you tried to turn down the volume, not only would the volume not go down down, but it would change the channel and you would have static blasted into your ear.
EDIT: This was 10 or so years ago, when "portable radio" was still a thing you didn't laugh at. I imagine they were going for the cool factor, and it looked pretty cool indeed, you clicked the knob to turn it on and off and it was completely round and only had a very small antenna (2 inches or so) and it could clip onto your belt. It came free with a tee shirt I bought, so I guess I can't complain.

[–]RanShaw 1513 points 15 hours ago*
Actually, it's because humans gained the ability of speech that we can choke on food.
Other mammals (and human infants) can breathe and eat at the same time, because their larynx is relatively high up in their throats. The human larynx has evolved to be lower down in our throats, in order to accomodate for speech. That's why we can choke on stuff, whereas other mammals can't the risk of choking is lower for other mammals.

Evolution can explain why there are genetic diseases which are harmful etc. Here is some wikipedia about how that can happen. Warning, you may have to click open a few other articles
As for this being bad reasoning. I betcha anything your reasoning for your theistic/atheistic beliefs makes equal or less sense. Almost every religion I've ever heard of has mankind as being something special, and this shows that mankind is in fact nothing special.

Pandas: everything about them is a design flaw.
permalinkreportgive goldreply
[–]PoglaTheGrate 2390 points 14 hours ago
They are a carnivore...
That only eats bamboo shoots.
Their mouth has evolved to eat their diet, so their lips are constantly in pressure, so they can't close their mouths properly.
They don't get enough energy from their food source, so they have to eat constantly.
Furthermore, their food source is so low in nutrients, they cannot hibernate, like EVERY OTHER FUCKING MEMBER OF THE URSIDAE FAMILY
Because they have evolved to only eat bamboo, they cannot eat anything else.
They females are only on heat for two or three days every freakin' year.
Every single captive Panda is the property of the Chinese Government, so if a zoo wants to try a captive breeding programme, they have to pay rental on a Panda to the Chinese. Only big and profitable zoos can afford to keep two or more Pandas. (Ok, that isn't bad design, just bad luck)

The engine of my 1999 Chrysler LHS. It's the only car I've ever seen where you have to remove the wheel to reach the battery. If I want to do even the simplest repair, I have to remove 20 parts to reach it.
It's also the only one I've seen where you can't put antifreeze in the radiator. You have to remove the reservoir cap, warm up the engine, shut it off, and put it in the backup reservoir until it backs up into the tank, and repeat until the heater works again.

The Panzerkampfwagen V Panther (Panther Tank) came with sloped armour. On early models this included sloped armour on the gun mantle. The problem with this was that enemy shells which hit the underside of the gun mantle and failed to penetrate would be deflected downwards onto much thinner armour which was only 15mm thick (compared to over 100mm thick on the gun mantle). Below that 15mm thick armour was the driver, radio operator, transmission and AMMUNITION. Needless to say a round that failed to penetrate the gun mantle could still spell doom for the Panther Tank. Luckily it was fixed in 1944 in the G model (the Panther first saw action in 1943) by making the underside of the gun mantle just a straight up and down piece rather than rounded. Well, mostly fixed as due to the constraints of war a number of Panther G tanks were still fitted with the older gun mantles.

Oh god, if we're going to talk about tanks, lets mention the M3 Lee. So, for the start of WW2, America needed a 75mm gun, but they didn't know how to make the large rotating turret, so they decided to casemate it onto the body of the tank, meaning the turret couldn't rotate. In addition to this, they didn't really have a suitable tank engine, so they just decided to stick an airplane engine in there. Unfortunately, airplane radial engines are really big, which made the tank horrendously tall, and a much larger target. Another problem was that the early versions of the tank had rivets on its armor plating, which had a tendency to pop off and kill the people inside the tank when it was hit by a round. All around, kind of a shitty excuse for a tank, but we made a shit ton of them, and really damn fast too.

USB plug. You have to flip it over two times before it goes in!

That's not a flaw at all. It's a feature! USB plugs exit in 4 dimensional space! That's amazing!

When I bought my house I noticed a light socket over a doorway with no bulb in it, so I put one in. Then I opened the door, which promptly ran right into the light bulb.

My in-laws teapot. Its spout is slanted in a wrong angle, so you can't pour tea without spilling a lot. The spout is also geometrichally challenged so that you have to tilt the pot so much to pour that the lid slides off. The handle is shaped so that while tilting the pot, your hand will slide up and connect with the hot pot so the grip is uncomfortable. They have used that pot every time we've been over for the last decade, and they (and we) complain just as much every time. My husbands uncle have now announced that he has bought a new one, hopefully a better one, for the upcoming birthday in october, so hopefully It'll be better next time. Some products are just not user-tested.

The old sideways Nokia chargers, they'd block up two plug points or force you to rearrange the plug setup. Couldn't they just make it vertical?

Evolution gave us a tail bone but no tail.
Too bad, I could have had so much fun with my tail.
Edit: I never said I wanted it for a "sexual" manner.

Alternatively, evolution half-arsed removing the tail

Some really poorly placed cup holders in cars.
Either right up against the console with ALL THE ELECTRONIC THINGS AND BUTTONS, making them sticky and/or inoperable if any splashing occurs.
Too close to said console or underneath the ledge of the console to fit properly (especially Taco Bell cups...they're THE WORST).
Non-adjustable, shallow, or otherwise shittiliy designed...I have yet to find cup holders in a vehicle that I wouldn't not consider to be a poorly designed afterthought.
I realize this is probably less of an issue in most countries, but in America we live and eat in our cars a lot.

Small kitchen with poorly placed frige. You can open it all the way, but you have to leave the kitchen to do it....and then you are blocked by its door.
Edit:this was a small kitchen...very small. Even if I bothered to deal with the door rotation I would still need to press my body against the kabinets to let it skirt by me. Decided not to rent the place instead.

My dentist explained to me what they were for. Apparently, back in the days before good dental hygiene and cavemen ate tons of rough, uncooked grains/veggies, your teeth got eroded fast. By the time, you're in your teens, most people would already ruin most of their teeth, so that's when the wisdom teeth pop up as spare teeth.

I once paid good money for a thing called a 'she-pee', so I could pee at Glastonbury Festival without having to sit on those terrible toilets. Fail. It went all down my leg and I had to walk back to the tent with wet jeans. Horrible. I tried it in the shower when I came home but I've never managed to use it successfully. Why invent something so great and then do such a terrible job of it?

If you lock a toyota camry with the key fob then open it with the actual key, it sets off the alarm. Sucks every time my key fob battery dies.

Government issued civilian SUVs. If you work overseas for the US Government, they'll give you an armored SUV to drive. Accept it has a function where as soon you turn off the ignition, every door unlocks instantly.
A lot of people know this, including Guatemalan criminals.
