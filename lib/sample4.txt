"I'm surprised that you kept an actual naked photo of you that long ago. Its a lot easier these days to hide files on the computer.  &gt; Kidding I'm only 5'7. Nah. It's a weird illusion made by the placement of the child's other hand. The soldier's other fingers are tucked around the girl's hand and what you see instead is the girl's fingers on her other hand.  In response to the bit about your old therapist being slapped by her mom, I would agree that that is not a good way to handle a situation. It is clear that good came from the bad, and that's okay. The atheist response to that is that the mom acted immorally even though good resulted in some form. Good could also have resulted if the mom handled the situation better. There are multiple options for acting morally, and that's literally what the \"Moral Landscape\" is. Her actions were maybe a flat part of the landscape, but they certainly weren't a peak that would show a truly moral action.\n\nAs for everything else, we simply have a very different opinion on the whole matter. I feel like you evaded the 10 Commandments question, but that's okay. It's one of those problems that's just out of our hands. I don't expect you to justify rape, nor do I expect you to discredit one of the cardinal principles of the Bible.\n\nYour ideas about atheism make it sound like we don't value life or don't hold any importance in relationships, passion, endeavors, or anything valuable. We are in this life on Earth just the same as you are, and for all the feelings you feel we feel the same feelings. The most common atheist response I've heard to your claim is that atheists value life more than Christians because we don't center our actions around an afterlife. Our interactions in life are all we've got, so we value life as if it's everything. A better life is a life where flourishing overshadows any suffering, so an atheist will do more to increase flourishing in life. Just don't make a new character in the same slot. They added a splash screen in the game detailing this. Alright.  Fine.  Here we go, then.  Let's talk fallacies.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;I never said purple dogs are a logical fallacy...\n\n-------------------------------\n\n&gt;Dogs are purple, spot is a dog, therefore spot is purple! And when you say \"but not all dogs are purple!\" I can't turn around and say \"STOP POINT OUT **FALLACIES**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSure sounds like you did.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;...can you read?\n\nAd hominem.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;...as good as a crazy man standing on a soapbox yelling...\n\nStrawman.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;...are you going to actually try and learn about logic before trying to lecture me on it?\n\nNot exactly a fallacy, but it doesn't matter what I say in response to this as you have obviously already formed your opinion. Would you guys do T-Rich for Blackmon? Boxer Invaders. Please. [zoom in](http://i.imgur.com/TSprGTr.png) Brandon Weeden, after figuring out he has already lost his job, starts swinging for the fences with every play and throws for over 400 yards with 3 TD's and 3 INT's. Eliezer Yudkowsky has something similar. There might be some stuff you can do to fix it. What he tried is here http://hpmor.com/notes/98/ PS2 printer cables This typo really fucked me off. I spent a good 5 seconds being confused then I was angry at the large amount of text ahead of me which is possibly infested with more typos. NWT reporting for duty. It is completely rational to expect a person who I want to be my partner for the rest of my life to be have the same values that I do, would I women who didn't want to date a man who had to many partners be slut shaming the man? i tried, but i guess i wasn't tired enough. It was a failure for me as well. \"Mom, I wish you dead.\"\n\n\nThe boy, only two years old, quoted a line he heard on TV. He said it, somewhat seriously, half just because he'd heard it; he said because his Mother took away his toys from the dinner table because he refused to eat. \n\n\"Mummy! Not hungry! Momma, I wish you dead. Dead! Dead! Dead!\" His fists bounced up and down on the table. \n\nHis dad, stationed over two hundred miles away, the family had just moved into a new house, in a new city, in a new country, on a new continent. Just to close the ever-growing gap between them and the man of the house. At least now, he could come home once a month, for an entire week. He had left yesterday, so the child was more excited than ever and all he wanted to do was play with his toys and see his father.\n\n\"Mommy! I not hungry!\"\n\n***\n\nShe laid him down to rest, after a battle over peas, which she lost. He grasped at her face with open palms, reaching for the same toy he had at the dinner table. \n\n\"Bedtime honey!\"\n\n\"Momma! TOY! Now!\n\n\"No, hon, it's bedtime.\"\n\n\"I wish you dead!!!\" \n\nShe went to bed crying, *how could he say that to her, his Mother?*\n\n***\n\nHe woke himself up the next day, hungry, but his Mom was nowhere to be found. He searched each room in the house thoroughly, until he got to her room; where she was laying, frozen, her skin a slight shade of blue.\n\n***\n\nFour days had passed since the boy ate the last piece of food he could reach, he was laying on his bed, fighting sleep, tears endlessly streaming down his cheeks, until finally succumbing to the ever-creeping silence of the light fading from his sight, and he fell asleep for the last time. If you like it, steal it.  I'm not going to any of the fall tour shows for geographic reasons. So far, from kits. I built this in anticipation of going all-grain brewing soon. Cargo bob? Quit acting like every fucking thing the majority votes for is good for the minority. just diggin for gold DAE that comment amirite here's an upgoat He is John F\"N cena...\n\nOr he never got his WWE Championship rematch so due to that title being held up he can challenge for the WHC if he wanted to. &gt; \"So where are you from? Do you have any family? What brings you up here? What color are your eyes? I just met you, and this is crazy...\"\n\n&gt; That one is a little difficult to swallow. \n\nOr, imagine this, since he's an experienced astronaut, and she's not. He's trying to keep her talking and thinking about everything *BUT* what just happened so she doesn't freak out more. I fear if we all watch things get progressively worse in this country while asking \"where is the proof\", the proof is likely to roll down the street in  a vehicle we don't want to see in our neighborhoods and knock down in our doors. By then it's too late and the proof shall be laying at somebody's feet.\n\nTo me the proof is not in what one man says but in the totality of actions taken, laws passed, executive orders signed, a judicial system that plays favorites, and \"leaders\" whom are all bankrolled by corporations that have the farthest thing from our best interests in mind when it comes time to post profits... just to name a few.\n\nWhile you are waiting for the paid for MSM or someone come out and give you proof, it seems many of us are planning escape routes, packing bags, and ensuring we have the means to defend and feed ourselves and our families. I for one would rather hope for the best but always be prepared for the worst. Good luck to you. it has to do with finding a high quality partner to pairbond with...a woman who takes her sexuality seriously enough to not have lots of partners at an early age is more likely to be loyal and committed to the life partner of her choosing.  I can't quote the studies I've read unfortunately but I have seen stats about the relationship between a woman's number of partners and happiness and faithfulness in a marriage...therefore men looking for a committment innately respond more positively to women who haven't had a train run on them by the opening band for Black Sabbath.  This is certainly not a popular view with some people but it has been shown to be at least somewhat of a reality regardless.\n\nI'm sure there are exceptions to the rule, but I've seen this played out with a good female friend of mine who is well into the triple digits and guys won't take her seriously as an option if she gives them the real number or anything close...time and time again. this old ass nigga dead lmao Memes are allowed as long as **both the image** and the text are gaming related. Read the rules good sir! long day For about a day, cookie chains had no upper limit except what was in your bank. So you could get arbitrarily large cookie bank by getting good enough cookie chains. Several people reported achieving sexillions of cookies by this method. FTA:\n\n&gt; He warned that terrorists now had tens of thousands of means of communication \"through e-mail, IP telephony, in-game communication, social networking, chat rooms, anonymising services and a myriad of mobile apps\". Mr Parker said it was vital for MI5 - and by inference its partner GCHQ - to retain the capability to access such information if the Security Service was to protect the country.\n\nThis is just scaring citizens to give up any and all privacy.  It's a season long injury, or at least 10 weeks at minimum. TELL ME THE STORY!!! It's a mask for when Joey on Friends got the chicken stuck on his head. \"I have darker things in mind!\" I agree it definitely will get people more excited about space exploration and that's awesome! And you're right, it is important to think positive (as I was obviously being a little pessimistic). However, it is still dumbfounding that many people will walk out of the theater and still not do more research themselves to realize how much cool stuff NASA as well as other space organizations do. This is inevitable. &gt;use their conscious\n\nA glimpse into the brilliant libertarian mind. I just had lunch with a couple of these fine people today. 3 kids in tow at 2 in the afternoon at a sushi joint. I paid for my wife and I with money we earned. Apparently we bought part of their fancy lunch too since they paid with EBT. fuck that get him on the Patriots. 075? please and thankyou Pacific NW shout out! Half of my family is Mormon. It is really common for them to go to the temple to baptize our insanely distant (read: 100+years ago) posthumously. As someone who is strongly opposed to their faith I will be furious if they do this to me, and I can understand why the families of those who were baptized would be irate.  85564 It's true that against Midrange or Control you can probably ride a Key + Cranial Plating to victory. But the guy with the aggro deck usually ends up in finals and he just wipes the floor if he happens to face an answer-light deck that can't race him. I do want to support mono-brown as an archetype tough, but it's pretty hard to do so without hosing other archetypes or making the cube bigger. I was in a similar position as you with my ex boyfriend. \nHe never did lose the weight. I sat on the porch to watch the world end. Disappointment followed. Give em hell! keep us updated OP! Fighting game market feels saturated right now.  There's just too many damn games out Success Kid makes the front page no matter how many failures led up to the success in the end. Still /u/MagicalTaco Physics major here - my Pro is amazing for this, the P2 can only be better. Dachshunds tend to get increasingly needy as they age. My 16 year old dachshund whines all the time, and she's on 2 painkillers twice daily so I know she's not feeling any pain. She's hungry all the time, but that's just a constant for her since she's a dachshund and would eat herself to death if we let her. ? How's that possible....? &gt; One more thing you calling others trash sounds rather deceptively smug.\n\nComing from somebody whose sole purpose in posting this story appears to be in building consensus for yet another fraudulent war for Israel?  Wow. Come on, Rays!\n\nI've got my Moore cowbell ready and I want to ring it Demaryius at the 2nd/3rd turn and Gordon in the 10th have both been good for me. AP at 1 was nice as well. Cigarettes. They'll be forever burned into my nose. He scores through placement the majority of the time and certainly his shot power is below average for a striker. Never met a girl who liked games. But my last ex (who hated games) was glued to my TV while I played The Last Of Us.  Would anyone else agree that this would've made a great love story between Barb and Jordan in the music video? Look at :20 and see how they bump in and listen to the lyrics at the time. I'm blown away by the detail, and I can't thank you enough. (What's that about kaiju? GET THE JAGERS AND MOVE) do u sleep? The number of bails this guy must of done to perfect something like that. Gnomes. No fuckin clue why I have so many Gnomes.  I feel like Mexican flavors are a great place to start on a budget, but that may just be because I have a lot of Mexican markets with cheap spices and beans available in my area.\n\nTomato, onion, garlic, fresh coriander (cilantro), cumin, win.\n\nI used to do meatless taco nights, which is great when emptying out your fridge, but might not be as cost-effective if you go out to buy all the ingredients. Soft corn tortillas, minced red onion, diced red bell pepper, refried beans, rice if you're inclined, tidbits of pineapple, jalapeno (fresh, or picked, as they last a lot longer that way), fresh coriander (cilantro), diced fresh tomatoes. Avocado if you have the cash. Don't need to have a lot of each; they'll go a long way. Tl;Dr hasty decisions put me in Korea My roommate is selling his '12 Cruz. Pm if you want details  \"Is you taking notes on a criminal fucking conspiracy?\"\n\nThe Wire june of 2012 I've considered it but it's really hard due to many factors - flatmates,small bathroom, camera (use my laptop to take pics), water, lights, no bath tub. Sure we are TerdFurgeson on Xbox live.  We are not very hi ranking guys just having fun and trying to make money. In Korea, everyone is 1 when they are born. When the next year rolls around, the age is incremented. Thus, somebody born on December 30th would be 2 years old within days of birth. \n\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_age_reckoning#Korean I did. I'm just wondering in general, who I could get. My runningback situation isn't great considering I have Spiller, Woodhead, and La'Veon Bell. On the other hand, I have (debatably) the best TE's in Thomas and Graham. They need to specify the type of feminist, but I'm thinking more along the lines of Anita Sarkeesian.\n\nIf I could get some damned armor for my female characters that isn't ridiculous, I'd be so happy. Nothing irks me more than bikini lingerie armor...Now if it's a culture like the Norn where the men and women dress because they wanna show off their six-packs, biceps, and tattoos, then it's fine. Like so many people, you seem to think that this is a man/woman issue.  But the law doesn't care about either the man or the woman- the law is made so that the kids get the most support possible, so that the taxpayer doesn't need to pick up the slack. http://www.1851project.com/2013/08/20/i%E2%80%99ve-got-a-new-home-at-1851/ I use these instead of buying garbage bags.

Have you ever been to a high school track? We'll, that's 400 meters for you right there. Have you ever gotten a 2 liter Coke from the supermarket? Yep that's metric. Have you ever bought an gram (or 3.5) of weed? Yep, again metric.

It's designed to wear out the defense, not injure them. If they can't handle it, injuries are an easy cop out. Slowing down a teams offense for 2 minutes while you cry and limp off field only to come back a play later is horseshit.  ^^ill ^acknowledge this ^^comment with ^a Greek ^^letter\n\nπ I want to call bullshit, but I've done something close. Cool man/woman. (Assuming you are a man given your /u/. It's definitely worthwhile to check out the man page for apt-get, some other commands are:\n\n**apt-get dist-upgrade** upgrades packages which has dependencies which require removal of other packages on your system.\n\n**apt-get autoremove** removes unneeded packages anymore.
