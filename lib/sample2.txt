When I was growing up there was a strange guy in my town. He was an albino and looked like he was in his mid-forties. Nobody seemed to know his name and I don't know anybody that had ever spoken to him or heard him speak. He wore the same outfit every time I saw him. Long, black coat (a bit like Silent Bob's), black trousers, brown shoes. He would just walk around all day. He was just always around. I remember seeing him for the first time when I was 5 or 6. I pointed out to my mum how white he was (I'd never seen an albino before). I saw him every time I went into town for 20 years. For 20 years he wore the same outfit and he never seemed to age.
The creepiest part: My mum remembers him being around when she was little. My grandparents also remember him being around when they were kids (in the 1930s). He seems to have just always been there. Same age, same outfit for decades. I no longer live in the town but people I know who still do say he's still there now. Hasn't changed a bit. It's strange, the way people talk about him. It's so casual as if it's normal to have a guy in your town who doesn't age, doesn't change his clothes and doesn't speak.

As the mysterious albino disappears, OP gets a strange tingling on his skin, a tickling, as if he had a bug land on his skin. OP looks down at his skin to see what is making him feel so weird, only to discover that he was now albino. In a fleeting moment of panic, OP lets out a terrifying screech of pure fear, only to find that he is now mute. Things were strange for OP after that, he silently boarded his plane and eventually came back to his current residence. OP found that it was now his fate to be immortal, a man as invincible as god himself. OP took no pleasure in his new ability, and instead spent his days walking the streets thinking and seeing. On his endless journey of introspection, OP saw more like him; gods that were doomed to walk among men, or rather men doomed to walk around as gods.

Considering life expectancy is from 77.5 to 80 years old in the US that would dictate that "middle" aged should be 38.5 to 40 years old, I understand the actual definition is later in the human life span, but shouldn't middle aged be half the life expectancy?

My grandparents and their next door neighbors raised their kids together and my dad was really good friends with their son and they played and hung out and stuff pretty much their whole lives. The next door neighbors' son comes home to visit one day and stabs his parents in their sleep, 20-30 times each in the abdomen and chest. The dad died and the mom survived but is now a shut-in. I had to bring her mail one time and she wouldn't even open the latch. I had to push her mail through the slot in the door. Poor lady.

Essentially, my hometown has a history of mental illness institutions and our elementary school was built right in the middle of a complex of buildings known as the Skillman Epileptic Village. Apparently, their was a story circulating that the doctors had raped the female patients and when they got pregnant the doctors would perform abortions and bury the fetuses in the hospital's baseball field - the same field which our 3rd and 4th grade teachers would take us out to play kickball on.

The Lemps were a prominent brewing family in St. Louis. Their mansion, which is still open as a tourist spot, is supposedly haunted due to a history of family madness. At least three members of the family committed suicide in the mansion, and there are reports of a "monkey faced ghost" that is the spirit of a child with Down's Syndrome who was hidden away from public view.

I knew this would show up eventually. Been there many times, having grown up in the area, and while it's a great campfire story, there's little mystery or anything else going on up there, really just a terrible place to have built a pre-industrial revolution village is all.
But it is one hell of a campfire story ;)
Torrington has it's share of creepy stories, The Yankee Pedlar Inn for example, which was the focus of a recent movie; The Little girl in White of Oak Ave is another. And the Burr Family Cemetery is said to have a haunt or two, though I lived next to it for half my life, and it was just an overgrown jungle of ivy and tombstones.
I'm sure I could think of more, and will add detail to the ones above when I get a chance, but I'm about to run out for a bit. But Litchfield County in general is full of old-school creepy.
EDIT
For those that want a bit more info on the history and legend of Dudleytown, you can check this site out. Information collected and written up by Rev Gary Dudley(an actual descendant), it does a pretty good job covering both legend and history. Mind you, it's old now, and probably not been updated since the late '00s, the info is still relevant. warning, potential crappy old autoplay music, not sure if it still works or not, didn't for me, so probably long since dead

I may have some of the details FUBAR'd but as I recall it's our Bigfoot and is seen in the Northwestern Area of the Lower Peninsula (Traverse City area).
It's basically a man with a dog's head and stalks/attacks hunters/lumberjacks and sometimes leads a pack of feral dogs that attack people. In some versions, he's only seen in years ending in 7.
Like OP's Melon Heads, searching for it was a local summer & moonshine ritual for teens in the area. Went "two tracking" with the locals many times looking for the Dog Man in rural Kalkaska but all we ever found was people chasing us off their land with shotguns.
A Traverse City DJ wrote a song about it in the 80s that's regionally popular. I think his name was Steve or John Cook. He sold copies of it and donated the proceeds to the Humane Society.
EDIT: Here's the song

Have you heard the story of the Pink Castle? My mom told me about it but I never saw anything online about it. Apparently there was a big abandoned house controlled by bikers who would sacrifice animals, and even sometimes rape and sacrifice people. They would perform these demonic rituals while doing this. There was also a haunted factory in a town in Michigan that got torn down. I went in it a few times and heard noises, but it was most likely cops looking for trespassers.
EDIT: I was looking through some site about haunted places and people claim the footsteps are part of the haunting. I know my dad's house is haunted but the guy just chills on the stairs or in the basement not bothering people. The Southgate one in the high school pool isn't true. I was studying there for ROTC and never once saw or felt a ghost in there.

These two cheerleaders were housesitting one night and randomly went missing.
Days later, parts of their bodies were found and the guy who ended up killing them was a family man who lived near them.
It was terrifying and left the region really traumatized, because the guy was just a regular local with a six year old daughter of his own.
He hung himself in his cell a month later.

There is a road near me which has a wall running alongside it for about 50 metres. An extremely abnormal amount of cars crash into this wall (I'd say about 20 per year), even though it is completely straight and there is no bend in the road. The people never even seem to hit it hard, just bash into it.
Anyway, supposedly, the reason that they crash into it is because some nights, a dog appears in the middle of the road and makes them swerve away and into the wall and when they look for the dog, it is gone.
I try to avoid the road at night.

A favorite in my home town of Grand Canyon, though not paranormal, is of Glen and Bessie Hyde. They were newlyweds who decided to raft the Colorado River (through the Grand Canyon) for their honeymoon in 1928. About halfway through their trip they hiked from Phantom Ranch (the biggest development at the bottom of the canyon) up to the rim to resupply. On their resupply trip they met photographer Emery Kolb.
Once they finished the resupply trip they returned to the river and were never seen again.
Once a search was started, their boat was found over 100 miles downstream from Phantom Ranch with all supplies strapped in and intact. Their bodies were never found.
Almost fifty years later a woman on a commercial rafting trip through Grand Canyon claimed to be Bessie Hyde, and said Glen had become abusive, so she had stabbed him and hiked out. Five years after that, a male skeleton was found in the home of Emery Kolb with a bullet hole through its skull. Neither story was ever confirmed.

Somehow, in spite of this being in no way supernatural, is the creepiest one I've heard. Maybe because it's so easily a true story, and there is the mystery of what actually happened, because something did happen.
Also, because it doesn't just sound like something you make up to tell little kids to scare them, or girls so they snuggle up closer to you, or something.

In Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, there used to be a old homeless lady who sat outside of the cathedral every day. The thing is that at midnight a black fancy car would pull over with two men in suit and the lady would go into the car and they will drive out the city (Notice the city isn't that big, so you would be out of it in like 15 - 20 min from downtown).Obviously people noticed and they would follow up the car, but all the cars would break and no one could ever saw where they took the lady. My uncle tried to follow them and he and his friends had a back up plan, they took a 4X4 and two motorcycles on the trunk, so if the car breaks, they still have another way to go on. They did as planned , and when they were on the highway the car broke, so they went for the motorcycles, but they we broke as well.

My hometown was a town in New England that was very active during the witch trials. There's a dirt path that used to be a road (it's way overgrown now, if it weren't for the 'DO NOT ENTER' gate blocking the place you wouldn't even know it was there) by the water tower. So the legend goes that during the witch trial era a couple gave birth to albino twins in a house on that road. They were hidden away from the public for years, until around their adolescence a local boy saw one of them through the windows. They were presumed to be witches, and, as was custom, had rocks tied to their feet and thrown into a local lake as their parents watched to see if they would drown (if they drowned, they were witches. I know this 'witch test' varies but this was the version used in this case). Of course, they did, and the parents were locked in their house by an angry mob led by the local preacher and burned to death. The ghosts of the twins/parents can supposedly be seen at night and it's a very creepy place, if you go down the path.

To elaborate it was(supposedly) that she thought she was being haunted by all the ghosts of people killed by the Winchester Rifle, the source of her fortune. A psychic told her that the only way to escape the ghosts, and thus have peace was to build a house so large and confusing that the ghosts would be unable to find her within it. Also she supposedly slept in a different room every night. She spent her fortune continuously adding on to the house until she died. Weird stuff.

The city cemetery is supposedly haunted by a ghost whose wife died there. He didn't want anyone else to be buried in that cemetery, so he bought the land and "pushed" everyone else out. He ended up dying and was buried on his cemetery property. Now when cars drive down the hill of the cemetery, they are pushed back up the hill. I went to do this and it was quite true... You are still on a downward incline, we put the car in neutral, and the car started to move upwards very slowly. Weiiirrdddd....

There is a crypt in the cemetary in the town I live in, which has a headless angel on the front vault doors. You can see her when you shine your headlights on the doors (I have seen this). There is also a bleeding heart on the side of the crypt that was supposely painted by a girl so the angel would protect her boyfriend. Legend states he died in a car wreck shortly after and the heart started to bleed. I was actually brave enough to get out of the car and feel where the heart bled and it does actually feel like the consistancy of blood.
On a lighter not there is also a crypt in the same cemetary where an old lady was buried in her rocking chair. On nights where the moon is bright you can hear her rocking her chair in the crypt and if you ask her what she is doing she will say "Nothing".

Maxdale Bridge. Pretty much everyone in my hometown knows about this bridge and the legend behind it. Here it is in a nutshell:
The cemetery is haunted by an old man with a limp thought to be the previous caretaker.
It is believed that an old man with a limp haunts this very old cemetery; some say he was the caretaker. There is also a small old iron bridge you have to cross to get to the cemetery, which is also believed to be haunted. If you go at night to visit the cemetery and you stop on the bridge, turn off your headlights, count to ten, then turn them back on, there will be a man hanging from a noose. He is believed to have hanged himself when he could not save the life of his girlfriend, who had drowned in the river under the bridge.
A man committed suicide by driving his truck off a small bridge on the road to the right side of the cemetery. Witnesses report a phantom old truck appearing behind them and chasing them for a moment. There are also reports of a sad presence felt through out the entire cemetery.
Here's a picture of Maxdale Bridge. I have yet to visit the place, but everyone I know who did had experienced some weird shit. Who knows, maybe I'll visit it during Halloween.

There were rumors that there was a rich landowner in a village in Guatemala who was a very brutal man. Every year, he would send one of his employees (he had farms) during the night on some errand. The person would never return. The locals said the people never returned because they were being sacrificed to the devil as part of a bargain that made the man rich. Locals also rumored that the man would dance behind his house while wearing a scary mask and that the next morning, bags of money would appear at his door. The mask is still passed on to the eldest male.

I live in a small town in Ct that holds the remnants of the little people village. Legend has it a man and his wife were leaving peacefully in my small town about a century ago. Rumor has it the women was a witch, and would hear voice in the dead of night. One day the women ordered her husband to build a village for her, but on a small scale for the fairies she ruled. The man did as she said and constructed an elaborate town for the creatures his wife claimed to rule. He then build a grand thrown for his wife to sit on and over see her people. Though out the construction process his wife would become more enraged by the day, and she eventually killed her husband. She claimed the little people commanded her to. Fast forward to today, and you can go to the ruins of the little town. But if you sit on the witches thrown, you will die in 7 years.

Not the town I live in but the one next to it (barely a mile away so it makes no difference).
Basically there's an urban legend about a woman who is obsessed with the actor Johnny Depp, and by obsessed I mean she carries around his autobiography everywhere and keeps pictures of him with her and that sort of thing. But that's not the best part...
... She also carries around a plastic baby, and claims that it's Johnny Depp's child, like she actually tells people that its the love child of her and Depp.
Not sure if its 100% true (for obvious reasons) but a pretty interesting (and creepy) story nevertheless.

This isn't creepy in the "spooky" way. It's more creepy in the "I can't believe people behave like that" way.
In the town where I went to high school, a girl got pregnant. During the pregnancy, she basically pretended that it wasn't real. The most literal interpretation of "ignore your problems" possible. Photos of her drinking and smoking were all over her Facebook.
Then, when she finally had the baby, she continued that pattern. By leaving the live baby in a dumpster. Makes me shudder.

Cincinnati's Dent Schoolhouse... Around the early 1940's there was a series of missing students from the schoolhouse. Police investigated, but they couldn't find any leads, and the case quieted down. A few years later, in early 1950's, several more students went missing. Just like the first kids, they couldn't be found either. Eventually a nasty smell started to come up from under the floorboards and everyone began to suspect the janitor, who lived in the basement of the school. Upon questioning, he vanished. A mob of the children's families broke into the basement and they discovered the remains of the children buried within the walls of the basement. Charlie, the janitor, has never been caught and it remains an on going investigation. Supposedly, it's still haunted today!

Robert the Doll was given to a young child in Key West, Florida, by a Bahamian servant skilled at voodoo and black magic in the early twentieth century. The boy would talk to the doll and claimed that it could move from room to room at night, emitting a terrifying giggle. When the family moved they left the doll behind in the attic, and it was found by the new owner's ten year old daughter. She stated that Robert would attack her and threatened to kill her on numerous occasions. The doll is now on display in a museum 104 years later, where you can take his picture - but only if you ask nicely. If not, legend says, you and your family will also be cursed.
Robert was the inspiration for Chucky in Child's Play.

He lived un-captured for a few years and was only caught when someone called the police to report a strange man in their neighbor's house. The whole thing ended in a car chase through the business district where the guy was caught and put up. He was the talk of the town for some time, he even had a nickname taken from his preferred way of killing. He was called the "Scranton Strangler."

On Christmas a few years ago, a family of a girl who went to my high school all sat down to open their gifts and enjoy Christmas Day. Not long into it, the girl's father came into their apartment dressed as Santa Claus. Of course, everyone played along thinking that he was there to surprise the young children etc. He then pulled out a gun and shot them all right there before taking his own life.

In the Long Island Sound, near a town called Port Washington, NY; there is a lighthouse on a tiny island called "Execution Rocks". According to local legend, back before the Revolutionary War, British officers would tie traitors and villains to the rocks at low tide. As the tide slowly came in, the water would rise, eventually drowning the poor bastards. Once the tide went back out, the bodies would sit rotting in the sun, as an example for all the sailors passing the island.

100's of years ago, a woman in the town where I live was excused of witchcraft and punished with death. When the townsfolk were leading her to the gallows, she supposedly put a curse on the town and warned that one day she'd rise from the dead and terrorize the place she lived and loathed. To make sure she didn't make a visit to the town after her death, the townsfolk decided to cut her body into two halves so that her body could never join together and rise from the dead. So, there are two graves for this 'witch'. One is simply named "Upper Melinda" (Melinda was her name), the other "Lower Melinda". The only grave that can be found today is "Lower Melinda". It's kind of a tradition now for kids to go to her lower half of Melinda's grave and "wake her up".
TL;DR: A witch put a curse on our town. Body was buried in two halves.

In my area The Stickney Mansion (Aka The house with no Corners) and the surrounding area in Bull Valley Illinois was always the center of the local myths. I always heard these story's growing up, but much to my surprise most of them turned out to be true to some extent.
We always heard story's about "The house with no corners", as its known to most of the younger kids. It's called this because the house was built specifically to have no corners because the owners/builders where spiritualists and built the house in 1904 and intended the house to be a spiritualist retreat where they can have company over for seances and practice their beliefs, apparently they believed that "corners can trap souls and energy". However by accident the contractors ended up building in one single corner during construction.
The Myth/story that I heard goes as follows: one night they summoned something "Evil and beyond their control" and life in the house was never the same. Soon after this event the wife was found dead in the house, and then soon after they found George Stickney (the owner) slumped over dead in the only corner in the house. And is still haunted by that spirit/ghost/demon today.
Ever since, most of the people who tried to move in did not live there very long and was left abandoned for a long time. Since the local police had so much problems with trespassing and vandalism at the house they decided to make it the local police department. And the Story/myth continues that many of the police officers that have worked there have story's of voices, noises, and things they could not explain.
Here are some links

No corners would be an echoing madness! So much room for bouncing sound.

Well, I come from a rural area near a monastery. The monastery had a sexual abuse scandal that's still ongoing with allegations and investigations- some of the monks were abusing boys and young men at the preparatory school, the church, and the college. This is also the area where Jacob Wetterling went missing.
About a decade ago, a local college student went missing. They made posters, got the word out, held vigils, searched the woods and the wetlands, and dived and dredged in the lakes, but they didn't find anything of him. The only clue came early in the investigation, when they brought in hounds to sniff out his trail. The hounds caught his scent from where he disappeared, and led the cops to the doors of the monastery- but the monks barred the police from searching their grounds.
We have lots of ghost stories in the area- the monk that drowned by the chapel, the weeping sister in the cemetary, the blue light from the Quad and the rumors of the exorcisms that used to happen there. There are also lots of stories of great beasts coming down from the north woods- the cougar, the black wolf, the bear. Those stories don't disturb me half as much as the living, two-legged monsters we know share our hills.

There was a creepy old man who lived in the Canadian town I grew up in. He looked like what youd imagine a dirty farmer would look. He walked everywhere in the town and his favorite bar was on the Main Street of the town. The story went that he molested his grandmother before killing her with an axe and that as a result of his crimes he was chemically castrated.

This one isnt "supposedly true". http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/robert_hansen/index.html
My Grandfather was one of this guys best freinds. They used to fly airplanes together. He said this bastard had so much control over his plane that he could land its wheels on a peice of sheet paper.
My mother interviewed to be his secretary, she said he was a little off, but seemed normal enough. The only reason she didn't get the job as his secretary was because she got hired as a preschool teacher at a local synagog instead. We may not be Jewish, but I owe a great deal to the local Jewish community. Who know if she had worked for him, if she would ahve been one of his victims.

My friend's father chopped up his wife with an axe, and stufffed the body into a barrel, then threw it into the lake.
The barrel washed up into the swimming area, and the man died in prison.

There was a school in this town where they brought children (as young as 4 or 5) that were taken from their parents (often through force or coercion). They would load up the children into the backs of old army trucks and drive for hours and hours to the school, not stopping at all, so the kids would have to sit in their own piss and shit. At the school, they would beat these children and starve them (on purpose as experiments). Sometimes the kids would be raped or molested too. Children who died were often tossed into mass graves and the parents never heard about them again. This went on for years and years and years.
All true.

Was totally gonna call this out as being like the Canadian residential schools. Then I saw your name. I'm sad to say it is indeed true.

In San Antonio, Texas during the 1930s a school bus drove across an intersection of roadway crossed by railroad tracks, and then stalled. A train soon collided with the bus, instantly killing the driver and his ten tiny passengers. To this day, the ghost children allegedly haunt the site to protect others from a similar fate. It is believed that if a car stalls or stops on the tracks, the ghosts of the little children will push the vehicle to safety, their tiny handprints appearing across the rear of the car.

Um.
About a year after I moved here, the police found a woman cut up and stuffed in a barrel.
They arrested a guy for it about a month later.
This is not the only body-in-a-barrel story for my town. We also like to leave people in burning cars in the desert.

A couple months after I moved to my current town, there was a pair of legs found just north of town.
Just a pair of legs; nothing else was ever found.

Well mine is 100% true. Not sure if you've heard of the murder of Polly Klaas? Young girl kidnapped from a slumber party and killed. It got national attention back in the day... and it's still a scary thought.

In Cedarburg, Wisconsin at least one student from every class (high school) dies. This is a small town, only 12k or so and the high school is pretty small. From at least 2001 someone has died. Car crash, rare disease, and heroin overdose have been among the causes and all before graduation.

I lived in Plainfield, Wisconsin, for four months while finishing up a film project during the mid-1990s. There isn't necessarily a particular story, but Plainfield was the stomping-ground for old Ed Gein. I was very glad to have that place in my rear-view mirror.

Well, my home town has had a few bad things happen to it.
There was a women who bar tended at a local bar in the 90's who was well known and liked. One night an acquaintance of hers got way to drunk to drive home so she gave him a ride. On the way to his house, he overpowered her at a stop sign in a wooded area in the middle of nowhere (I live in the mid west and he lived on a farm) raped and burned her. The woods are still a little sketchy to be in just because of that happening.
There was also a murder suicide of a family in my town. During Christmas the eldest son of a family got mad, went upstairs, grabbed a shotgun, and killed everyone. The total body count was 7, including 3 children ages from 8-12. No real haunting stories about that, but creepy none the less
