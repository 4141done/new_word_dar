However it emphasizes that industries must uphold the national interest as superior to private profit.[169]\"", "No they are not fascist, even economically, let alone politically. Part of fascism is a policy of autarky (economic self-sufficiency and an opposition to free trade), which no western government even remote claims to follow. Claiming to practice third position economics was one element of the fascist platform, but that alone does not make one a fascist.", "What we see here is a breakdown of semantics. In truth, fascist economics was born out of the crisis of unrestrained capitalism that led in large part to world war 1. The synthesis of proletarian and bourgeoise classes into the Nation was merely one particular avenue used to remedy this crisis at one particular time, in the context of massive nationally discriminant socioeconomic ruin brought on by the war.\n\nThe point is that fascism is best understood not as a single point or an isolated incident, but rather as resting on a continuum that continues to be relevant as the underlying economic crisis has not been resolved, only delayed.\n\nToday, due to a list of social factors too long to fully enumerate, the balance of power has swung towards the corporations as opposed to the nation-state. One of these factors is the need for constant growing markets, markets unsustainable within any single nation: the collapse of Hitler's National Socialism, Stalin's similarly failed \"Socialism in one Country\" policies and even the degeneration of Southern Europe's welfare states illustrate this continually growing problem in the global economy. Governments are too small to house capitalism, and too small to house the burden. Even the United States and Western Europe are feeling this pain: look at how the US struggled to bail out their large banks and remaining industry, and how unemployment remains (according to federal 1993 metrics) over 20%...\n\nThis is accompanied by the establishment of powerful &amp; unelected international organizations dedicated to high finance's systemic maintenance. Further, the growth of corporate marketshare parallels this. Look at the rise of today's mega companies: what does it mean for democracy, when any corporation can challenge a peoples' environmental legislation in an unelected court on the grounds it undermines the sacrosanct \"right to profit\"? The US clean air act was assaulted this way in the early 2000s.\n\nEssentially, economic elites around the globe have won leverage over their political elites, and now hold most of the power. This is destabilizing and radical, and yet still harkens back to the 20th century's statist ideology in important ways.

The destruction of the Taqi al-Din observatory (the last scientific institution in the muslim world) in 1580 marks the beginning of the muslim dark age.

The West invented lots of stuff, and until the early 20th Century women couldn't even vote.

You know who had well recorded gender equality? Sikhs.

I just asked over in [/r/askhistorians.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1qzn0k/did_the_first_nations_have_oral_records_of_gender/)\n\n&gt;The answer is going to vary a bit depending on what part of North America you're looking at and when, but in general, especially in the east, Euro-Americans in the colonial era developed an erroneous view that indigenous men were lazy and treated women only a little better than slaves. This view developed because men and women had separate economic roles. Women were in charge of farming, managing the family's land and wealth, and producing most of the products used at home. Men were in charge of hunting, war, trade, and producing the tools and weapons necessary for those activities. Both categories of labor was essential for indigenous economies. But from a European perspective hunting was a luxury pastime, not a necessity, so it seemed as though the men were out having fun while the women slaved away in the field.\n\n&gt;This holds true for the Haudenosaunee--the Iroquois. The Clan Mothers, a position elected by the residents of a longhouse from among the venerable women of their clan, oversaw much of local politics. They settled disputes within their longhouses, divided up the clan's land to individual families for farming, and appointed the clan's representative to the Grand Council. These representatives were always men, but the Clan Mothers were their principal constituents and if he failed to adequately represent the Clan Mothers' interests it was within their power to remove him from office.\n\n&gt;While they couldn't be on the Grand Council, women could become local chiefs. For example, Aliquippa was the leader (\"Queen\" in British sources) of a large Seneca village in the vicinity of modern day Pittsburgh during the French-and-Indian War. She negotiated a brief military alliance with George Washington and dispatched warriors, duties usually associated with men. Aliquippa demonstrates a trend in the east: it's not uncommon for women to be able to cross the line separating the roles of men from the roles of women. Men had a far more difficult time stepping out of their assigned gender roles in the east. \n\n&gt;You may find the auto/biography of Mary Jemison useful for your discussion. When she was 15, she was captured by Shawnee during the French-and-Indian War and given to the Seneca, who adopted her as one of their own (another responsibility of women: determining the fate of war captives). Thereafter, she identified as a Seneca and remained with them even when should could have returned to Euro-American society. After living as a Seneca, this is what she had to say about the labor situation I mentioned earlier:\n\n&gt;*Our labor was not severe; and that of one year was exactly similar, in almost every respect, to that of the others, without that endless variety that is to be observed in the common labor of the white people. Nothwithstanding the Indian women have all the fuel and bread to procure, and the cooking to perform, their task is probably not harder than that of white women, who have those articles provided for them; and their cares certainly not half as numerous, nor as great. In the summer season, we planted, tended and harvested our corn, and generally had our children with us; but had no master to oversee or drive us, so that we could work as leisurely as we pleased.*\n\n[Here's a book that was written about her.](http://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Life-Mrs-Mary-Jemison/dp/146105351X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384887127&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Life+of+Mary+Jemison)", "Well, I'm not going to argue with an /r/askhistorians mod.

Europe in general, and Denmark in particular, has an *exclusionary* national identity. In countries in the Americas, particularly the USA and Canada, citizenship is what determines national identity: an immigrant becomes an \"american\" once they get citizenship. Their children are given citizenship if they are born on American soil, no matter what. this means that immigrant groups, while they may retain significant elements of their former culture, become a part of the national identity. This is not really the case in European countries. With the arguable exception of the UK, most european countries are very homogeneous both ethnically and religiously. Citizenship is much more difficult to get, and is not even automatically conferred upon people born within the national territory (most countries are *jus sanguis*, meaning you need to have at least one parent who is a citizen to get citizenship). Furthermore, every country has a national identity that goes beyond just citizenship: a Danish person is ethnically Danish and protestant, an Italian is ethnically Italian and catholic. There is no place for immigrants in this national identity, and they therefore tend to band together with other immigrants (this happens in America too, Chinatown and Little Italy in New York for example) in order to be accepted somewhere. This in turn makes it even harder for immigrants to assimilate into the national culture. Denmark is particularly bad for immigrant assimilation because it has a state church that is taxpayer funded that most Danes belong to, even if they are nonreligious. The Danish identity that Hassan is criticizing immigrants for not assimilating into is an exclusionary one composed of white, ethnically danish, religiously protestant members of the state church. What place do dark skinned Arab muslims who live only with other immigrants have in it?

Ask any Marine, airman or Army guy who's been trying to train Iraqis and especially Afghans.  Islam is not only a religion, it's a way of life all the way around.  Yet another set of revealing facts about Muslim beliefs and traditions and ways of life.\n \n1400 years of inbreeding.\n \nI found this to be interesting--didn't know whether to believe it or not, to research I went to Wikipedia, \"Cousin Marriage\", and far down in the article \"Genetics\", It seems there is a lot of truth here.\n \nA huge Muslim problem: Inbreeding.\n \nNikolai Sennels is a Danish psychologist who has done extensive research into a little-known problem in the Muslim world: the disastrous results of Muslim inbreeding brought about by the marriage of first-cousins.\n \nThis practice, which has been prohibited in the Judeo-Christian tradition since the days of Moses, was sanctioned by Muhammad and has been going on now for 50 generations (1,400 years) in the Muslim world.\n \nThis practice of inbreeding will never go away in the Muslim world, since Muhammad is the ultimate example and authority on all matters, including marriage.\n \nThe massive inbreeding in Muslim culture may well have done virtually irreversible damage to the Muslim gene pool, including extensive damage to its intelligence, sanity, and health.\n \nAccording to Sennels, close to half of all Muslims in the world are inbred. In Pakistan, the numbers approach 70%. Even in England, more than half of Pakistani immigrants are married to their first cousins, and in Denmark the number of inbred Pakistani immigrants is around 40%.\n \nThe numbers are equally devastating in other important Muslim countries: 67% in Saudi Arabia, 64% in Jordan, and Kuwait, 63% in Sudan, 60% in Iraq, and 54% in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar .\n \nAccording to the BBC, this Pakistani, Muslim-inspired inbreeding is thought to explain the probability that a British Pakistani family is more than 13 times as likely to have children with recessive genetic disorders. While Pakistanis are responsible for three percent of the births in the UK , they account for 33% of children with genetic birth defects.\n \nThe risks of what are called autosomal recessive disorders such as cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy is 18 times higher and the risk of death due to malformations is 10 times higher.\n \nOther negative consequences of inbreeding include a 100 percent increase in the risk of still births and a 50% increase in the possibility that a child will die during labor.\n \nLowered intellectual capacity is another devastating consequence of Muslim marriage patterns. According to Sennels, research shows that children of consanguineous marriages lose 10-16 points off their IQ and that social abilities develop much slower in inbred babies. The risk of having an IQ lower than 70, the official demarcation for being classified as \"retarded,\" increases by an astonishing 400 percent among children of cousin marriages. (Similar effects were seen in the Pharaonic dynasties in ancient Egypt and in the British royal family, where inbreeding was the norm for a significant period of time.)\n \nIn Denmark, non-Western immigrants are more than 300 percent more likely to fail the intelligence test required for entrance into the Danish army.\n \nSennels says that \"the ability to enjoy and produce knowledge and abstract thinking is simply lower in the Islamic world.\" He points out that the Arab world translates just 330 books every year, about 20% of what Greece alone does.\n \nIn the last 1,200 years of Islam, just 100,000 books have been translated into Arabic, about what Spain does in a single year. Seven out of 10 Turks have never even read a book.\n \nSennels points out the difficulties this creates for Muslims seeking to succeed in the West. \"A lower IQ, together with a religion that denounces critical thinking, surely makes it harder for many Muslims to have success in our high-tech knowledge societies.\"\n \nOnly nine Muslims have ever won the Nobel Prize, and five of those were for the \"Peace Prize.\" According to Nature magazine, Muslim countries produce just 10 percent of the world average when it comes to scientific research measured by articles per million inhabitants.\n \nIn Denmark, Sennels' native country, Muslim children are grossly over represented among children with special needs. One-third of the budget for Danish schools is consumed by special education, and anywhere from 51% to 70% of retarded children with physical handicaps in Copenhagen have an immigrant background. Learning ability is severely affected as well. Studies indicated that 64% of school children with Arabic parents are still illiterate after 10 years in the Danish school system. The immigrant drop-out rate in Danish high schools is twice that of the native-born.\n \nMental illness is also a product. The closer the blood relative, the higher the risk of schizophrenic illness. The increased risk of insanity may explain why more than 40% of patients in Denmark 's biggest ward for clinically insane criminals have an immigrant background.\n \nThe U.S. is not immune. According to Sennels, \"One study based on 300,000 Americans shows that the majority of Muslims in the USA have a lower income, are less educated, and have worse jobs than the population as a whole.\"\n \nSennels concludes:\n \nThere is no doubt that the wide spread tradition of first cousin marriages among Muslims has harmed the gene pool among Muslims. Because Muslims' religious beliefs prohibit marrying non-Muslims and thus prevents them from adding fresh genetic material to their population, the genetic damage done to their gene pool since their prophet allowed first cousin marriages 1,400 years ago are most likely massive. This has produced overwhelming direct and indirect human and societal consequences.\n \nBottom line: Islam is not simply a benign and morally equivalent alternative to the Judeo-Christian tradition. As Sennels points out, the first and biggest victims of Islam are Muslims. Simple Judeo-Christian compassion for Muslims and a common-sense desire to protect Western civilization from the ravages of Islam, dictate a vigorous opposition to the spread of this dark and dangerous religion. These stark realities must be taken into account when we establish public polices dealing with immigration from Muslim countries and the building of mosques in the U.S.\n \nLet's hope the civilized West and the North Americans wake up before a blind naivete about the reality of Islam destroys what remains of our Judeo-Christian culture and our domestic tranquillity.", "I am so glad that the U.S doesn't have to deal with a lot of the bullshit that the E.U is going through right now.　We welcome far more immigrants than Europe does, and yet we don't have to deal with this bullshit.

Also, our immigrants know that breaking the law, especially hate crimes, will result in their immediate arrest and deportation.\n\nWe are no less a nation of immigrants, but because we don't tolerate vile, antisocial behavior as readily as some other countries, we have a more sane population law abiding immigrants.\n\nSo, a lesson to countries like Denmark if they are actually ever going to get serious about there problems. You could fix your problems if you didn't let in every bumpkin \"refugee\", actually punished people for terrorism (7 years and then released into the general population wtf?), and lastly find the  Imams who are leading the spread of hatred in your country, pull them out of their mosques, and beat the ever living shit out of them.", "More likely because you have an ocean seperating you from them.

Glen Greenwald is an unscrupulous businessman and disgraced attorney who fled from his debts, was chastised by the NYS Bar, and in his time since has grown into a fame-mongoring idiot; an incoherent spectacle not of journalism, but of American political punditry. He found some fame antagonizing the Bush Administration for its flimsy warrantless wiretapping claims, an has parlayed that into a career at every possible turn. It really wouldn't be surprising for him to completely blow the interpretation of documents, or attempt to skew it in a sensationalist fashion. The other two journalists Snowden leaked to have a lot more credibility, and seem to have been a lot more responsible in their analysis and accusations.\n\nNow lets get into the evidence. From the screenshot posted, here's what anyone can observe:\n\nLink: http://gfx.dagbladet.no/labrador/303/303870/30387028/jpg/active/978x.jpg\n\n1) The screenshot appears to show the number of records some NSA service has (perhaps Boundless Informant) access to for the month of December of last year in a DNR (Dial Number Recognition) library, as opposed to a DNI (Digital Network Intelligence) library that is somehow tagged as being related to Norway.\n\n2) The screenshot does not say who did it on behalf of whom, how or why, whom/where/what was targeted, or specify the depth of the records, ie whether it is just an identification of a call, a calling party, a complete record, etc... it also does not discuss whether these calls originated in Norway and entered the US, which would certainly be grounds for the NSA having a record of them, or whether another party (say, Norway's own military intelligence) accessed the information, created the records, and then shared it with the NSA. Without seeing actual records, we have no idea what the provenance of the records are, or what the records actually contain, without which it is impossible to come to his conclusions.\n\n3) It looks like the SIGAD for the source is US-987F, and it looks like that could possibly correlate with DRTBOX, but we don't really know what that is (however, there was some speculation related to some of the German / French releases). A SIGAD is a way the NSA keeps track of the source program of a certain piece of signal intelligence. There are thousands of these.\n\n4) More importantly, we do know something about similar SIGADs. US-900 series are usually NSA run, and this appears to be a subset of the primary 987 source; but we know other 987 SIGADs are 3rd party listening sites which only share information with the NSA and are npt run by the NSA: US-987L, US-987LA and US-987LB are all German BND sources, US-987D is considered 3rd party unknown, so likely, US-987F is not even operated by the US— rational organizational structure would put it with a 3rd party intelligence organization, likely part of NATO.\n\n5) This would imply that the NSA is not actively conducting the operation, but is rather engaged in a sharing relationship. Whether the source, US-987F is spying on Norway for the NSA, or whether Norway is spying on other people FOR the NSA, we have no idea. In both situations, the information would be tagged as records coming from Norway.\n\n6) The most interesting thing is what does the downtime around the holidays represent?\n\nConclusion: It's not really clear what any of this means, and its completely hilarious and insane that a newspaper and Greenwald would make an allegation based on such a contextless and uninformative screenshot. There is absolutely no evidence to support his claims, and even more likely, it looks like Snowden might not have taken enough information to substantiate the \"juiciest\" allegations against the NSA.

There is however, admissions, and primary source evidence that these organizations have collaborated together to do this internationally!\n\n&gt;the NSA's docs according to him show that this is collection done against a country and that it is collection of documents about the country primarily,\n\nShow me the documents! If the NSA isn't the one doing it, this has nothing to do with the NSA! If every country is doing it to themselves, thats a substantively different story!\n\nBut he can't even prove that; all he can show is that something related to the calls was tagged as Norway, or France, etc... and while Boundless Informant FAQ appears to imply it requires a cell number with that country code, it doesn't say anything about the location of the phone, or whether both phones are domestic, international, etc...\n\nThere is no fucking information provided in any of these articles to support the accusations he makes.", "Uh, you may want to learn to read. I can link stories and claim it is a retraction too. It is literally the opposite of a retraction: they are claiming the story is true and the government officials lied. \n\n&gt;Show me the documents!\n\nI did show you the documents. The Boundless Informant link. The \"Sample Use Cases\" all use \"against\" to describe collection from a foreign government and \"for\" to describe collection for a friendly program.

We get to allies and look, it's all done for them! Totally. \n\nAs for what is collected, it is clear that Dialed Number Recorder (DNR) records are meta-data which is what the original story said. Know how it's clear? Because it says \"DNR metadata\" in the same Boundless Informant link I gave. Nobody is claiming it is a recording of the actual voice. ", "&gt;Uh, you may want to learn to read. I can link stories and claim it is a retraction too. It is literally the opposite of a retraction: they are claiming the story is true and the government officials lied.\n\nNo they aren't. They are claim the French Government officials lied when they expressed outrage over the breach, and that it appears the outrage was feigned, because in fact, French Intelligence was providing the intelligence to the NSA themselves, rather than the NSA gathering the intelligence without French permission.\n\nThis is an out-and-out reversal on the claim made in the original article and disclosure, that the NSA recorded 70 million plus phone calls. It is an explicit admission that the NSA recorded ZERO phone calls.\n\n&gt;The \"Sample Use Cases\" all use \"against\" to describe collection from a foreign government and \"for\" to describe collection for a friendly program.\n\nOh god... is this really what you're getting at? For/Against is not being used in the way you think it is. It's an information plotting term, ie there are n objects for every class X, or plot velocity against time. It's analytical, its not a hostile/friendly term. Is this really what Greenwald is claiming?\n\nFor example: What is the field of view for a specifc site? What countries does it collect against?\n\nThis means you can access data like: \"X site has collection abilities 1, 2, 3, and can collect in countries A, B, C. Show me a chart of this.\"\n\nIt's not about a hostile vs. friendly program. At all. Only on the site specific level, when you drill down to one site, do you know whether the site is operated by the NSA, or a foreign intelligence service, all you know on the country level is that you are getting all this data fed in to you about X country from a bunch of sites— there's no explicit discussion of which sites do what, are run by whom, etc...\n\n&gt;It's strange that when Boundless Informant reporting was on Latin America the NSA didn't claim it was done for those countries (and of course in case of Brazil there has been a rather large and even surprising non-fake fallout). We get to allies and look, it's all done for them! Totally.\n\n....I have no idea what you're saying here... you're reading a lot in to generic analytical language in a nonspecific FAQ which does not discuss specific allies or enemies.\n\nYou'll have to show me some other slides if you want me to really follow this interpretation. The Norway slide makes no mention of for or against.\n\nAre you really saying that we don't have mutual intelligence agreements with basically every member of NATO? Other documents leak arrangements not just between the five eyes, but the other tiers of NSA allies, the nine and the fourteen. One set of documents is true but the other isn't?\n\n\n&gt;Nobody is claiming it is a recording of the actual voice.\n\nI will draw your attention to the headline:\n\n&gt;NSA recorded more than 30 million phone calls made in its Nato ally Norway, in the latest Snowden revelations. \"It is unacceptable,\" says Norway's Justice Minister. \"A crime under Norwegian law,\" says head of telecoms regulator. \n", "Yes, they are. In fact you are the one lying when you claim the article even suggests NSA did not record any calls: it notes that the French agency was aware of \"some\" of the data, but also even notes that government sources are not aware of 70.3 million records (so now the NSA document is wrong, or government sources are lying or don't know what they're talking about or what? I'd like to see you respond.)\n\n&gt;Oh god... is this really what you're getting at? For/Against is not being used in the way you think it is. It's an information plotting term, ie there are n objects for every class X, or plot velocity against time\n\nI work in research, I know how plotting terms are used. The document describes exactly the same type of plotting (if you want to claim that is what's being referred to) and uses the word \"for\" when it's talking about a friendly program and \"against\" when it's talking about foreign countries. It does this consistently throughout all use cases. How do you exactly explain why one plots \"for\" a friendly program and \"against\" a country when the lines are completely the same and what is being plotted is completely the same? \n\nE.g.: How many records are collected for an organizational unit (e.g. FORNSAT)?  \nE.g.: How many records are collected against a particular country?\n\nIf this is talking about plotting, the logic of the two sentences is exactly the same and it makes utterly no sense to use \"for\" in the second sentence and \"against\" in the first. \n\nThere is lots of other evidence of course (in fact I gave some obvious evidence already: at no point did the NSA claim that all previous disclosures of Boundless Informant against Latin America were done with that country's consent, and I doubt Brazil would consent to the NSA spying on its state owned oil company). \n\n&gt;....I have no idea what you're saying here\n\nThe Latin America disclosures in large part based on slides from Boundless Informant. At no point did the NSA claim these collections were done for the host country or with their assistance. These are the same revelations that show NSA spied on corporations in those countries. This is not under dispute. This has caused non-fake large outrage, Obama has been trying to court Brazil's president with several invited visits and tried to send people down there. Up until now all Boundless Informant revelations have been undisputed done against the countries.. now suddenly we get to allies and oh look it's totally done for them.  \n\n&gt;I will draw your attention to the headline\n\nRecorded metadata, not content. The article linked This was made clear in the article, but anyway one would think this would be pretty clear regardless given that this is not the first type of revelation like this. ", "&gt;Yes, they are. In fact you are the one lying when you claim the article even suggests NSA did not record any calls: it notes that the French agency was aware of \"some\" of the data, but also even notes that government sources are not aware of 70.3 million records (so now the NSA document is wrong, or government sources are lying or don't know what they're talking about or what? I'd like to see you respond.)\n\nIt means Snowden didn't take enough documents to understand how BoundlessInformant actually works. His screenshots of the French tagged records likely are aggregating data from multiple sites, so the while many may have come from French Intelligence, not necessarily all of them had to. Many could have come from other partners when one of the numbers associated with a call was French, or some other component was involved. This is a vast information collection network. It would be very weird if the only records related to France came only from sites inside France, even if we're only talking about DRTBOX and WHITEBOX. Naturally we would correlate from across our network and end up with more results, even if we weren't directly spying on anyone in France (though of course, anyone in France calling the US, we would certainly be lawfully allowed to, and have our own intercept sites for).\n\n&gt;If this is talking about plotting, the logic of the two sentences is exactly the same and it makes utterly no sense to use \"for\" in the second sentence and \"against\" in the first.\n\nOf course it makes sense. It's an external vs. internal delineation, but you're misunderstanding what \"for\" means here. For an organizational unit means at its request on a specific subject, topic, or project. When they file a request you can see all the types of data you're collecting to fulfill that request. \n\nAgainst would contain things the NSA collected, as well as data collected by other foreign agencies fed into the system.\n\nThink about it as.... input to a database as all the against, where as the \"for\" stuff being output from a search. \n\nBoundlessInformant is a very top level analytical tool for figuring out where all this stuff comes from, and finding additional sources that project managers may not even know exist that then can be queried. That's why you have the \"top techs\" and five programs with the most volume. US-985D was the top French program consisting of WHITEBOX and DRTBOX, but what that actually consisted of, and whether the French are numbering it the same way, is anyones guess.\n\nPeople are throwing around 70 million calls recorded, but then its metadata from 70 million calls, to 70 million pieces of metadata. French Intelligence admits it was sharing, thats where it came from.\n\nIn order for your analysis to be true, we refer to all collection as against, regardless by whom; and that's fine with me, its consistent with the term adversary etc...\n\n&gt;The Latin America disclosures in large part based on slides from Boundless Informant. At no point did the NSA claim these collections were done for the host country or with their assistance.\n\nBecause we don't have information sharing agreements with them. Its not that the collection is done, its that the query is performed for them.\n\n&gt;These are the same revelations that show NSA spied on corporations in those countries. This is not under dispute. \n\nI don't know what you're getting at here. Why would we not spy on Brazil?\n\n&gt;This has caused non-fake large outrage, Obama has been trying to court Brazil's president with several invited visits and tried to send people down there.\n\nGreat. So what? They should've known we were doing this, but its no different than our programs against Russia and China. No idea what you're getting at.\n\nFORNSAT is part of UKUSA, they likely have the authority to make a request from some NSA databases, so stuff is done for them; but collection that AUS intelligence sites perform would still be considered as against australia.\n\n&gt;Up until now all Boundless Informant revelations have been undisputed done against the countries.. now suddenly we get to allies and oh look it's totally done for them.\n\nI get what you're saying now. I think I've explained it.\n\n&gt;Recorded metadata, not content.\n\nThen the word is improperly used; a record of an event is different than a recording of the event. It is either intentionally misleading and incendiary, or just incorrect.\n\n&gt;This was made clear in the article, but anyway one would think this would be pretty clear regardless given that this is not the first type of revelation like this.\n\nNo, they always lead with the most headline grabbing form and parry it down.", "Would make sense.

When the death was not related to the journalist's work the conviction rate exceeds 90%. When the journalist's death was certainly or seems likely to have been related to his or her work, the rate of acquittals rises sharply to around half of the total. Most trials are still held before a judge, aided by two lay assessors. Trial by judge and jury, still very rare in Russia, generally offers a more rigorous testing of evidence, robust defence of the suspects and a higher chance of the defendant being found not guilty (average acquittal rate of 20%). The Politkovskaya murder trial, which was held before a jury, ended in February 2009 with the acquittal of all those accused.\n\nSo the Russian system manages a 90% conviction rate for journalists who get murdered without the tacit backing of the state or only 50% with.

This dismisses someone's point of view based on criticism of the person's inconsistency and not the position presented[2] whereas a person's inconsistency should not discredit the position. Thus, it is a form of the ad hominem argument.[3] To clarify, although the person being attacked might indeed be acting inconsistently or hypocritically, this does not invalidate their argument.\n\nWhich it isn't.

But the thing is, unlike other British colonies in the area: India, Singapore, Malaysia, Java, Burma etc.; Australia did not adopt any of the culture of the original inhabitants in it's insemination. \n\nThat puts Australia at odds with the rest of the oceanic area which had existed in a culture of trading prior to British involvement.

It was just a sad fact that we brought disease that had not been exposed to the original populations prior, and it almost wiped them out. \n\nSo when you say this is racist, I think you are purposefully ignoring the definition of the term 'Western' that is being used in order to state your case. The definition being spoken about here has to do with the cultural aspects of the country. As in our Greek and Roman base.
