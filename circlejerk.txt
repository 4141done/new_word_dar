 DAE think the mods are literally Hitler? Does anybody else get the  feeling that this subreddit is becoming a huge circlejerk?  What does this have to do with breaking bad? Carl Sagan died for my right to not view the sidebar. This is just another attempt by fascists mods like /u/jij and /u/Boobies_Are_Awesome to control what we can jerk about! SO I JUST GOT ONE QUESTION FOR YOUR FUCKING MODS! **DO YOU EVEN LIFT?** 10/10, would upvote again thanks, obama. wtf baa I see u everywhere k Each and every subscriber must upvote this post. 

The mods **will** ban you for not following these rules. My comment can't really follow the format of the original post but it doesn't matter, **you've already invested too much time in this comment by reading this far not to upvote**. You are also impressed by the bold letters which caught your eye in the first place. 

***Bold AND Italicized letters.***   What I don't get is how this post is at the top page with more down votes than up votes. Are mods able to sticky or something? The mods are literally more fascist than Barack "Hussein" Obama REPORTED TO THE MODS ENJOY YOUR BAN FUCKER

**EA** DAE GTA V? You forgot to mention how /u/jij is litrali hitler This is a repost, have an upsagan Say my name.

You're goddamn right. Haha. Love the teamed up downvotes too.

If this makes you feel better, go ahead and believe it. Longboards just make speed easier (and with the right set up you can go just as fast with a old school or standard, longboards just make going downhill easier) , and yes, takes far less skill. Dont fool yourself.

Not that I really care. This convo has just stemmed from my statement that they are shitty boards, and that they are. It has been thoroughly entertaining to watch 2 kids get trolled, when trolling was NOT the goal.

As for doing backflips in my moms backyard, as your angsty offence to my statements presents, you most likely still live with yours. Some might say your joke but I say it's not too much enough. That some's name? It was you, all along.  DAE think Obama is wrong in hindering our proud troops from serving our country? you could've at least inserted a Peter Higgs reference. Is this the thread where we discuss hitler? DAE literal repost [I tip my Fedora to Albert Einstein and his son Carl Sagan](http://www.carolynallens.com/for_him/accessories/misc/images/fedora_small.jpg) I am S[weed]en(t)

Upsalites for you kind sir Pardon the intrusion of my neckbeard, kind gentlesir.  But I believe you are mistaken.  The name of the Albert Einstein that casted the vote for Ron Paul was actually Carbill DeSaganye.  Forgive my rudeness and I bid you a fond tip of the fedora. But did he open the safe?

*edit: Maybe I didn't make myself clear...I mentioned the safe. Upsteins to le left You, my friend, are epic.  RIP in peace fundies.

The USA is literally just as bad as nazi Germany. 

Edit: thanks for the gold random stranger I went to USA once and everyone was so fat there were rolls of fat hanging out into the street from people's houses and out of their car doors when driving.

Get yourselves together! This needed to be said.

^^^^^^^^^^^fat So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, "See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to." For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said "Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all." As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment FEELS LIKE COOKIECLICKER LOL

 My mouse works :D Hi. I dont really like to ask for karma, but i only need 5 more until my alienblue mobile will lie to me and say i have 8k karma. I would really appreciate it if you guys could help me out. Any amount donated helps. I am sorry, I'm on mobile. Of course it works (PC gamer here) "I came here to kick ass and get upvotes, and I'm all outta ass to kick." - Duke Nukem I totally understand the Higgs Boson particle.

As for doing backflips in my moms backyard, as your angsty offence to my statements presents, you most likely still live with yours. I believe it has something to do with karma theory. I would explain but I have to send a letter to congress accepting my position as supreme law maker. DAE Heisendog? No. Downvoted. You're exactly what's wrong with circlejerk. Instead of posting satire, mocking reddit and being clever and original, you continue to post lame phrases and beat to glue anything that was even remotely funny, all under the guise that you want to show what's wrong with reddit. You don't care about reddit. You belong to the system that this subreddit was made to mock. You seek karma. You seek to be a power-user, a well-known name in a sea of perpetual anonymity. The higher your karma-count, the more you get off on it. You are smug and self-satisfying. You are the problem. There should be a "delete" button below your posts. Start clicking them after you post and you'll find that reddit starts to improve. like...THIS. [+] **FastCarsShootinStars** comment score below threshold.

Edit: Thank you all for all your kind upvotes! :D

I've never had a comment reach such a high number of upvotes before. My previous record was this comment that was only upvoted cause I made a mistake and people wanted to make fun of me. Reddit has always been my favorite website ever, but unfortunately I've never had success with my posts before. This is due to my name. Since it is viewed as negative towards Reddit I'm always seen as a troll no matter what I do. People don't seem to understand how my name is simply ironic. Like how people from tf2 call the huntsman bow the cuntsman. Most of the people that call that bow that are the ones that use it themselves. Although I do identify myself as an atheist I do not shove my beliefs down the throats of others. I also do not own a fedora.
This name has caused me nothing but trouble. And although I disagree with the way people on this website handle it I cannot condemn them for it, as they're just trying to protect my favorite website.
At the time of writing this my comment has 751 upvotes. While that might not seem like much it really is. I brought joy to 751 real life people using the website that takes up most of my free time. I was able to payback the joy that this website has brought me than there are students at my high school.
And as exciting as this is I'm honestly a little upset. I fear this comment is the Minecraft to my Notch, the Sixth Sense to my Shyamalam. It's the thing I did best on this site and will never do better.
I will still use this site however i am done posting on it. I feel this is the classy, Seinfeld way of doing things. It is also not much of a loss as I was never really accepted as part of this site and banned from my favorite sub (which is because of my name, which I already discussed.)
And before this comment gets linked to r/cringe and people make fun of me for being so proud of what seems to be such a minuscule thing I should just nip that in the butt now and let you know you shouldn't. While I'm not popular I do not consider myself lonely. I do not live a sad life just a boring uneventful one. I am currently a high school senior on verge of graduating in a few months ranked in the top 100 of my graduating class. My life is about to get better so there's no need to feel bad for me.
I just want to end this note thinking all of you for the laughs. Reddit, you made my past few years a lot better than you'll ever know. &lt;3
 Your salty tears sustain our souls. The most INTELLECTUALLY ADVANCED human being is a 29 year old obese paraplegic neckbeard residing in Medford Township, New Jersey. He goes simply by the pseudonym "Calvin," wears nothing but a trench coat and fedora, and is responsible for fully 1/3 of the worlds cyber crime. First Fedora pic or it didn't happen.  You already sound like you have an amazing attitude! The fact that you feel and know you're a woman no matter where you are in transitioning, is really awesome in keeping that positive attitude. It can be a hard process, but I think that staying positive makes so much of a difference. I think the who passing/beauty culture can really be a major source of distress. There are some trans women that have spent huge amounts of money on every plastic surgery you could think of. Not only SRS, but full-body electrolysis for hair removal; complete Facial Feminization, which can including lowering the hairline to make the forehead smaller, shaving the adam's apple down, restructuring the jawline, nose jobs, breast implants, etc., etc. As much plastic surgery you can imagine on cis woman (and man), trans women of all ages have had all types of plastic surgery as well. But it's truly your choice. Some trans women are totally comfortable without any surgery. Some women absolutely cannot live without removing the boy parts. It's different for every person. The most important thing is what YOU are comfortable with, how you want to transition, and where you ultimately see yourself when you've completed transitioning. At our support group, we have people who started transitioning at all different ages. We have woman who lived straight-married, had children, even had a career in the military before transitioning. She's now a huge area advocate fighting for equal rights for trans folks. We have women who totally "pass" and have chosen not to have bottom surgery. It's all about your own comfort level -- what do you need to do as a person to feel happiness in knowing your outside reflects your inner womanhood. I completely understand what you meant when you said "look like a softer/curvier drag queen." I've noticed some older trans women I've met do tend to use a lot of makeup, when they'd be just as beautiful with less. But it's all personal comfort. One note about age, if you are going to have any surgeries, some people tend to heal faster at a younger age. But a few years probably won't make much of a difference. It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me? Also, HRT will not stop pattern baldness. But there are some great looking hair pieces or "wiglets" you can add to your own hair to give instant length and volume. And it can be fun to play with your hairstyles. I think we can all agree about the 90s being the best decade. I don't think anyone here was actually refuting that. &gt;The US is the most corrupt country in the WORLD and you guys seem to actually be DEFENDING it...

What does this have to do with Breaking Bad At this moment, are you euphoric?  **I have a PHD in pillows.** Let me clear up some pillow misconceptions with a ridiculously long comment that will later be posted on /r/bestof:
------------------------------------------------------------

A pillow is a cushion support for the head or other parts of the body, **usually used** while sleeping on a bed, or for the body as used on a couch or chair.[1]

There are also throw pillows[2] (also called toss pillows, and in the UK Pillow shams), which are pillows that are purely decorative and not designed for support or comfort. 

* A cushion[2] is a soft bag filled *with air or padding such as feathers* or foam rubber. In the United Kingdom, pillows used on chairs, sofas or daybeds are called cushions, with the word pillow used only for pillows on a bed. In the UK, cushions are usually square, while bed pillows are oblong.

Etymology[edit]

The word pillow comes from Middle English pilwe, from Old English pyle (akin to Old High German pfuliwi) and from Latin pulvinus. The first known use of the word pillow was before 12th century.[4]

History[edit]

Overview[edit]
The pillow has a strong historical presence wherever people have been civilized enough to desire more comfort than that of the floor or a piece of furniture.[5] The first people to use pillows were those who lived in early civilizations of Mesopotamia around 7,000 BC.[6] During this time, only the wealthy and more fortunate people of the world were the ones who used pillows.[6] The number of pillows symbolized status so the more pillows one owned the more affluence he or she held.[6] Pillows have always been produced around the world in order to help solve the old, reoccurring problem of neck, back, and shoulder pain while sleeping.[7] The pillow was also used in order to keep bugs and insects out of people's hair, mouth, nose, and ears while sleeping.

* **In ancient Egypt**
* Pillow use has been associated with the mummies and tombs of ancient Egypt dating back to 2055-1985 B.C.[8] Ancient Egyptian pillows were wooden or stone headrests.[8] These pillows were mostly used by placing them under the heads of the deceased because the head of a human was considered to be the essence of life and sacred.[8] The ancient Egyptians used these wooden or stone pillows in order to provide support to a corpse’s head, uphold body vigor, keep blood circulating, and keep demons away.[8]

**In ancient Europe**
The Romans and Greeks of ancient Europe mastered the* creation of the softer pillow. These pillows were stuffed with reeds, feathers, and straw in order to make them softer and mo*re comfortable.[9] **Only upper-class people typically owned these softer pillows, however all classes of people were allowed to use some type of pillow while sleeping in order to give them support.**[9] People in ancient Europe started to use pillows when going to church in order to kneel on while praying and to place holy books on.[5] 

* This is a tradition that still lives on today. Additionally, the Romans and Greeks used their pillows by placing them under the head of those deceased just like the ancient Egyptians did.[9] European pillows continue to have a lot of popularity still to this day because of their beauty and quality.

* In ancient China
Chinese dynasties used pillows that were made from a wide range of materials including bamboo, **jade, porcelain, wood, and bronze.[10]** 

*Porcelain pillows became the most popular*.[10] The use of the porcelain pillow first appeared in the Sui Dynasty between 581 and 618 while mass production of the porcelain pillow appeared in the Tang Dynasty between 618 and 907.[10] The Chinese decorated their pillows by making them different shapes and by painting pictures of animals, humans, and plants on them. 

* Ancient Chinese porcelain pillows reached their peak in terms of production and use during the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties between the 10th and 14th century, but slowly phased out during the Ming and Qing dynasties between 1368 and 1911 with the emergence of better pillow making materials.





* A Japanese pillow filled with plastic tubes in a mesh sack.

Internally, a pillow comprises a filler, often made from foam, synthetic plastic fibers, feathers, or down and viscoelastic foam and latex.[4] Traditionally straw was a filler, but this is uncomfortable and rarely used today. Feathers and down are the *most expensive and usually the most comfortable; they offer the advantage of softness* and their ability to conform to shapes desired by the **user, more so than foam or fiber** pillows. One of the disadvantages of a down-filled pillow is that a significant number of people are allergic to them. There are currently hypoallergenic varieties of down pillows to allow people sensitive to down to enjoy the comfort of feather or down pillows. 

* In Asia, buckwheat is a common filler, as are plastic imitations. Such pillows tend to be smaller than a standard pillow. In India, cotton is also a common filler and is considered[according to whom?] to be healthier than synthetic fills.

The fill is surrounded with a cover or shell made of cloth or silk, known as the pillow case or pillow slip. Some pillows have a fancier cover called a sham which is closed on all sides and usually has a slit in** the back through which the pillow is placed. Rectangular standard bed pillow cases usually do not have zippers, but instead have one** side open all the time, however, a zippered pillow protector is often placed around standard pillows with the case in turn covering the protector. It is recommended that all types of pillow covers be laundered periodically since they are the part that is in contact with a person's body. 

* But even with regular washing, pillows tend to accumulate dust and microbes among the fill and it is recommended[according to whom?] that they be replaced every few years, especially for those with allergies.



A pillow is designed to provide support and comfort to the body and head. *There are three main types of pillows; bed pillows, orthopedic* pillows and decorative pillows, with some overlapping of use between these. The appropriate size of a bed pillow depends on the size of the bed. In general a twin bed goes best with a standard pillow while for queen and king sized beds larger pillows are recommended.[11]

Beds[edit]


*Several pillows on a bed.*

* The classic bed pillow shape is usually a square or rectangle. In the US, they are common in these three sizes (in inches): Standard (20 x 26 inches), Queen (20 x 30 inches), and King (20 x 36 inches).[12]

Pillows are generally covered with a removable pillow** case, which facilitates laundering. Apart** from the color and from the material of which they are made, pillowcases are described by three characteristics:

* Size
* Features
* Opening/closing
* Size conforms to the pillow the case is to contain. They are typically described as:

&gt; Standard: (square) 16 in × 16 in (41 cm × 41 cm)
&gt; Square: 26 in × 26 in (66 cm × 66 cm)
&gt; Standard: 20 in × 26 in (51 cm × 66 cm)
&gt; Queen: 20 in × 30 in (51 cm × 76 cm)
&gt; King: 20 in × 36 in (51 cm × 91 cm)

* Square is also called continental in the UK. German pillow sizes are 80 cm × 80 cm (older) or 40 cm × 80 cm (newer). When considered as a subset of Bed Pillow, Euro pillows finish 26 in × 26 in and older style Travel Pillows commonly finished 12 in × 16 in.

The **main distinguishing feature is whether the pillow case is plain or with a valance around** the edge. In the former case this is described as 'plain style' and in the latter as 'Oxford style'.[this quote needs a citation]

* "Oxford … **has a 5cm-10cm valance round all four** sides. With a hemstitched or corded decoration around the inner edge of the valance."

The opening/closure of pillow cases ranges from *the straightforward approach in USA called simply bagstyle to the more usual European method with a pocket inside the open end to fully contain the pillow. This is Housewife style.*

"Housewife is … essentially a bag, with a flap in the open end to tuck the pillowcase behind to keep it in…"

*Other methods of closure are ties or buttons/buttonholes.*



* A body pillow with a light blue pillow case
Body pillow*s are as long as a full adult body, providing support to the head and neck at the top and to the knees and legs lower* down. This type of pillow can be especially useful in providing support for those who sleep on their sides and for pregnant women. Size is 40 cm x 140 cm.



* Neck pillows support the **neck by providing a deep area for the head to rest** and a supportive area to keep the neck in alignment with the spine while sleeping. These can also be known as cervical pillows.

Travel pillows provide support for the neck in a sitting position. **Their "U" shape fits around the back of the neck and keeps the head from slipping** into an uncomfortable and possibly harmful position during sleep. However, U-shaped pillows can sometimes force the head forwards creating neck stiffness.

Donut pillows are firm pillows shaped like a torus, *with a space in the middle to alleviate pressure on the tailbone area while sitting.* 

These pillows are used primarily by individuals who have suffered an injury to the tailbone area or who suffer pain from hemorrhoids or another ailment of the colon. Kevin Bacon famously used a pillow like this in the movie Footloose.[13]

Lumbar pillows are designed to support the inward curve of the lower back, filling the space created between the lower back and the back of the chair when in a sitting position. 

* **These pillows are generally used to support the lower back while driving or sitting, such as in an office chair. Orthopedic pillows are similar to Memory foam pillows.

*I hope this clears some things up.*

**TL;DR Pillows are cushions for your head.**

 Holy shit, how hard was it? What type of pillow was it and why is it Spacefoam? Is it just like they say???? I never flip my pillow, you know why? Because

It's probably because reddit is too underground at this point.  Was she an atheist? If not, yes, yes you were raped.  When will the world wake up and realize that men can be raped just like women? I'm so infuriated with reading this post.

EDIT: "All that glitters is not gold" -William Degrasse Shakespeare OP Delivered!!!! EDIT: thanks for the gold. I just celebrated with a nice glass of scotch while I caress my cat. This. EDIT: Thanks for the Ron Paul ITT: People not getting gold Can you please not give me Reddit Gold? I would like some gold, but I am literally too poor to spend a few of my own dollars. DAE upvotes &gt; gold? how do down vote u? LOLOLOL UPVOTED

DAE r/firstworldanarchists?  YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO  An upvote to you for being so humble. Okey dokey then. SHOTS FIRED SHOTS FIRED GTAV AMIRITE Please don't reddit gold me. Upvotes pl0x As a metal fan, this is pretty much what I expected. Given Norway's birth of black metal, the Swedish birth of melodic death metal, and the Fins' love of gothic metal, not to mention all of the Scandinavian states making heavy use of Viking metal, I think it's safe to assume that Scandinavia is the most metal place on Earth.
 test post2. K BREAKING: US economy in free fall - likely to return to gold standard for currency. The government is accepting reddit gold as formal currency now. 

We did it reedit!!!! This ^ Only 1790s kids will get this Look, people say I'm to young to be a 90's kid because I was born in 1999. I have you know that when I was inside my mom, I was listing to Queen, Nirvana, and many legends. You can't tell me if I'm not a 90's kid. I was born in the 90's, which makes me a 90's kid. I even dream that I was in a Queen concert. I was playing Mario and Sonic, which became popular in the 90's, so that makes me a rue 90's gamer. I wasn't playing the modern Mario and Sonic games, I was playing the 90's Mario and Sonic games.. You can't do nothing about that. Reddit thought me about real music. I remember being in /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu just waiting for a new comic about music. I remember being in 9gag just to realize how modern music sucks. I will never be a 00's and 10's kid. In my heart I was born in the 90's. In my brain I was a 90's kid. In my soul I was a 90's kid. The amount of upvotes on this comment determines how much obamacare gets passed If someone buys me gold for this comment, it will encourage spending and the economy will recover more quickly.

Edit: Whoa, did NOT expect gold for this!  Thanks!! Ok. Honestly? Fuck you guys. I've been to canada once and they are so much better than you fucking Americans. They don't have any debt. None. Not even the fucking citizens. Weed is legal, politicians are illegal and they know that I am just an unmotivated genius.


Jesus fucking Christ guys... Can we learn a lesson from these people please? It's not that hard. Just think for two seconds. You'll realize every religion is wrong and is just holding us back. The only way they know how to annotate is using scientific notation. I mean there is no simpler way to do things. Petition your local congressman to import a Canadian for the sake of not just America but humanity as a whole.  Hello. I'm fi[f]teen years old and cannot stand the music my generation likes. I prefer underground classics like nirvana and Britney Spears.

Obama (Stalin) The glorious neckbeard can be very intimidating to women, they see you as way out of their league.  Most likely need to leave and change their panties at first sight of you.  Rockin a semi myself right now Women are intimidated by your staggering intellect and how good you look in a fedora. I could explain this to you in more scientific terms because I am sure you were a genius as a five year old being an enlightened atheist/scientist since birth. As a Swiss person I demand my 25,000 comment karma.  Upvotes to the left please. What does this have to do with GTA V online Haha. Love the teamed up downvotes too.

If this makes you feel better, go ahead and believe it. Longboards just make speed easier (and with the right set up you can go just as fast with a old school or standard, longboards just make going downhill easier) , and yes, takes far less skill. Dont fool yourself.

Not that I really care. This convo has just stemmed from my statement that they are shitty boards, and that they are. It has been thoroughly entertaining to watch 2 kids get trolled, when trolling was NOT the goal.

As for doing backflips in my moms backyard, as your angsty offence to my statements presents, you most likely still live with yours. Wtf no gold? Fucing capitalist bankers That's moar than enough to live on.  Classic Gaben [That's kind true actually] Breaking Bad I know I'll get downvoted to non-existent hell for this (DAE atheism is good???), but I don't like Obama. *Braces for shitstorm*.

EDIT: Gold? Why thank you kind sir or madam! I am constantly laughed at by my peers in my 11th grade class for being the only atheist in the school. The bullies harass me and sometimes even take my fedora from me which makes me incredibly pissed. Yesterday, the biggest bully of them all, Wade, took a pair of scissors and tried to cut my neckbeard while I was sleeping in class (DAE edgy and doesn't pay attention in class?? XD). I don't think I have mentioned it yet but I have autism and smoke 420 weeds everyday. I finally stood up to a bully the other day and showed him that I am the motherfucking most intellectual person he has ever encountered. I looked the bully dead in the eyes and said "In this euphoric, I am moment. Not because some enlightened intelligence, but because of a phony gOD's blessing." The bully laughed at me and then I hit him.  I read every word lolololol /r/firstworldanarchists I'm so edgy Hitler is still alive. His new name? Nailed it bitch, Barack "literally Hitler, CEO of EA" Obama. [Tip it!](http://i.imgur.com/vPCD2dG.png) Upvote 4 upvote! Will upvote back 100% guaranteed!!!! He sounds pretty... euphedoric.
