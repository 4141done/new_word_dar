 Can we stop the spider posts. I've noticed an increase in them. Holy SHIT I went outside and found nature WTF. WTF is stuff that you don't expect...things that are shocking enough that they make the thought run through your mind or, better, out of your mouth. For one specific example, injuries are NOT WTF worthy. It's pretty well known that if you put your face on a belt sander you're going to be missing skin. Take that to /r/gore or something....it's an expected result to an action. Now, if you start itching your arm and suddenly thousands of baby spiders start crawling out, post that, because that is definitely unexpected Strange bugs, notes on cars, car crashes, are not WTF. Things that you would reasonably expect to happen are not WTF. For example, I was in a car crash. You could expect that my car is destroyed, or that I have been injured in some way. What I would not expect is to see clowns having a dance party beside my mangled body. That would be WTF. If I can post it on /r/pics or /r/funny or /r/mildlyinteresting it should not be posted here.  The problem lies with posts that belong in other subreddits like /r/funny or /r/pics. Case in point, the gif of a man pole vaulting during an athletic event on the front page of /r/WTF right now. That us cool, not WTF in any way.  Porn annoys me.

People parking in the wrong spot is just stupid.

Also, "people of walmart"  needs to be out. Personally, I've found that the longer I hang around this sub, the more the posts here look like they should in in /r/funny.  Maybe I'm just getting jaded/psycho.

I think overall that's my issue...maybe also an issue for others?

All I know is that I've had more LOL moments in this sub than /r/funny. You guys should start promoting other subs heavily. Subs like /r/gore and /r/bugs so that most content gets posted in those subreddit and keep /r/wtf for the misc wtf stuff I get tired of the  "I'll just leave this here" bullshit with no indication of what it is. Those should be deleted quickly.
also.......
"Made me say WTF"
"Showed up on my feed"
etc........... Photo manipulations that are obviously trying to achieve some shock value should not be regarded as WTF. I think it's akin to posting a video clip of a Nightmare on Elm Street scene and calling it WTF material. It's not. Same goes for comic strips and graffiti.  
   
Scary insects or spiders are not WTF.  
  
**Broken bones caused by sports are not WTF**. "OMG, look at my leg, it's all bendy now." Yes, that's because YOU FUCKING BROKE IT! X-rays of broken bones are the worst offenders.  
  
Animals being animals are not WTF. A lion eating a gazelle belongs on Discovery channel. I can watch dogs fucking in my back yard. Animal penises don't look like human penises. Get over it.  
  
Drunk people vomiting on themselves is pretty typical drunk behaviour. Stick around after hours at the bar if you want to see that.  
  
Anything to do with parking lots is bland material.  
  
People on public transit with erections is no longer shocking.  
  
Ass-cracks in Walmart... no.  
  
**Rule 34 is not WTF** **Rule 34 is not WTF** **Rule 34 is not WTF** **Rule 34 is not WTF** **Rule 34 is not WTF** **Rule 34 is not WTF** **Rule 34 is not WTF**  
  
Finding a severed finger in a can of Spaghetti-Os is good.  
    
  
A midget hanging by his testicles with a shark hook is good.  
  
  
 Can we stop the people of walmart post. Just make a /r/peopleofwalmart subreddit. WTF = what the fuck More shock, less /r/spacedicks If you post something that's truly WTF there's a very high chance it won't reach frontpage. If you post something very mild that's not really WTF worthy it has no problem reaching frontpage. Here's a small list of related subreddits. Most of these are in the sidbar, but there's a few more here.

Please read the sidebar of the linked subreddits before you post in them. Some have rules stricter than others. Some subreddits here are NSFW.

We don't allow selfposts here, but this sub does. /r/WTFdidIjustread


 Anything with "i can use google " in it is not wtf /r/WTF is what got most of my friends into reddit. One joined after spending half an hour looking at a compilation or over 100 mutilated genitals. He loved it, some where so horrific he couldn't look for any longer then it took for him to quickly scroll past. Those were his favorites, because another one of our friends was asking me for ideas for a M:TG deck and every time he looked over to ask me something there was a picture that was worst then the last and he stop his question and looked away. That day one person became a regular lurker who would spend over an hour every time he came over just looking at /r/WTF, and the other one swore there is nothing that could get him to come near reddit (he did change his mind). It has been because /r/WTF was truly wtf that 6 of my friends joined reddit. All from the morbid curiosity that this subreddit brings. 

It was artistic and terrible, it was beautiful and horrifying, it made you want to see more. There wasn't one thing that made /r/WTF what it is. It wasn't JUST the gore or the mutilations, it was the alluring side of humanity that most of us don't experience on a regular basis. It wasn't mundane.

Recently my group have questioned if /r/WTF has gotten worse or if we have gotten used to it. What was amazing about this subreddit was seeing what you don't see everyday, but now as a regular redditor this is normal, this is no longer something I haven't seen or felt before. Now when something someone else feels is wtf my friends and I often look and compare to something that made us wtf, such as what we can only describe as "predator penis."

Maybe /r/WTF isn't becoming less wtf we are just becoming used to it and it is no longer strange, but now is mundane. Maybe it is just us becoming desensitized and wanting ever worse endeavors. Can the mods please ban photos making fun of strangers in public?  
Just seems fucked up to me. The first thing I saw on r/WTF was a photo of a murdered corpse that was severed, covered in shit and had rats on it.

That made me say WHAT THE FUCK! not a car license plate. I hate the 'I saw a shitty car' posts. Shitty cars exist, the people that drive them are fucked up, but a car is just a car. Unless its really fucked up. Like a Mini Copper that's been converted into a dump truck. "I fell off a cliff 3 years ago, upvotes to the left" I'd say posts about rotting food, any kind of rotting food is not wtf. You leave something out for days, its going to rot. you go to a dodgy shop and the foods rotten? thats exactly what i expect to see.  Like a picture of a cut off penis with a cigarette in the urethra sitting on a park bench in utah is WTF. Not a spider, fuck you Arthur Koesler tried to define humour. He failed. What he did say, though, rings true here. We find things funny (startling, surprising) when our existing model gets a challenge. 

* I tried water polo, but my horse drowned. 

* A seal walks into a club...

Yes, corny, but the faint smile comes from the reassessment of what you thought you knew. WTF should be like that, the sweet granny with the poisoned shoe-knife. Man bites dog. If you must have insects, [make them insects that change how we think about them](http://oglaf.com/bugfuck/). NSFW, slightly I love how a leopard attacking its prey made the front page of WTF yesterday. Cause you know, in nature that never happens. &gt;All (&amp; only) things that make you say WTF.

This is way too loose in my opinion, especially considering how it lost it meaning more or less. If you listen to certain people: "wow WTF the ketchup is not coming out" or "WTF it's snowing in March" "[WTF this carrot is bigger than the ones I normally eat](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/14rh7t/i_found_this_carrot_in_my_colleges_dining_hall/)".

A commonly heard complaint is how /r/funny /r/wtf and /r/pics are basically one melt pot of cross-posting. How often is content shared between these subs? In my opinion, if it can be posted on /r/funny, it does not belong in /r/wtf. 

Also as a biomedical student, while I understand that not everyone has been exposed to medical books, 'textbook examples' of medical related images can be quite irritating to see in big quantities. E.g. embryonic development pics or, literally educational, gifs (wow we don't look human when we're inside the uterus), x-rays of patients with piercings (obviously piercings are not disappearing) or cyclopia, a very popular subject here.

I know medical content is difficult to regulate on such a massive website with people of all kinds of backgrounds, but I wish there is a certain 'threshold' of weirdness for content to be posted here. Maybe [this](http://i.imgur.com/O3AWg.jpg) could help.  It's obvious that we need a semi-untamed board gentlemen, that or more moderators who have the cohones to step on the collective balls of the 12 year olds we keep getting that post the silliest instagram images they could find, and don't even get me started on the 20lbs of repost we have to wade through every week. 

I see one of two options, we either leave WTF as it is and hope that it doesn't fester by adding a few tiny rules, or we go truly into what WTF can really mean. "Here is a terrorist who blew himself up!" Oh god no, not gore! Stop the presses, Johnyizkewl7272 isn't a fan of gore and runs to moderators 1-5 to complain! 

I'm sorry Johny, would it entertain you if the terrorist blew up, did a triple backflip and then impaled himself anally on a humvee radio antennae? (granted that would be entertaining as fuck..)

This is a grand board that is being corrupted by little slapfight posts of things that make me think I hopped onto a 9gag sneakpost. If it were up to me anyone caught posting things that weren't WTF to the highest order would be blockaded from posting here. I'm not saying that to be a dick, it's just I'm tired of the 500 spider posts, the reposts out the ass, the every little picture that makes me shrug my shoulders and downvote. WTF needs to be untamed in the right ways while still stomping on the collective throats of anyone trying to corrupt this marvelous subreddit. 

Will I get downvoted into oblivion for this post? Probably, do I care? Not really. I've spent so much time enjoying what this sub used to offer, multiple accounts over the years, etc. Now it just feels like Summer on 4chan, and no kids that isn't a good thing. For the love of God no more spiders/insects/nature -IN ITS RIGHTFUL STATE- ie. a goblin shark just being a goblin shark. If its half robot or something that's okay. gore should go to r/gore.
It isn't wtf.

now, the pictures of the car on the truck on the train on the plane that caused the gore? thats proper wtf. I find that gore is alright, but anything borderline insanity (Torture/beheadings), belong in a subreddit like /r/watchpeopledie. But maybe someone tore their arm off in a freak bicycle accident, that's WTF. Finding a blackwidow in your shoe, that's pretty tame, but that would make me say wtf. But finding a spider in your basement is not "wtf". Everything out there has at times made someone say WTF, but it depends on the circumstances of the post.

EG- "Gore"

-"Man beheaded by machinery" That should go to /r/morbidreality or /r/watchpeopledie
-"Some guy fell off his bike and his arms fell off" Now that's WTF worthy. Bugs and spiders in general are not wtf-worthy unless you happen to see a roach catching and killing an eagle or something along those lines.

I've said this so many times but gore =/= wtf. Unless the injury or the gore is wtf in context ("Look at this gash in my hand I got from this piece of bread!" could be wtf-worthy "gore"), then put it in /r/gore or /r/spacedicks or something.

Porn is not wtf, unless it is seriously extreme shit. If you want porn go to a porn subreddit or site or something.

And maybe require thread titles to state what the content of the post is? Instead of something like "It's a Bit Chilly Here" and having the picture be a picture of a person frozen to death, the title would have to pretty much say "Person Frozen to Death" or something. I get tired of opening previews for pictures whose threads have vague or intentionally misleading titles for the sake of getting a view. Seriously, there's no need for it. If people had to say EXACTLY what their content was, there'd be no need for tags. /r/wtf = WTF

/r/mildyinteresting = Wow, that's fascinating Stop posting double parking pictures or shit like you openes a box and your candle was broken inside. WTF is gore, serial killers, fucked up shit. Lol No more bugs . why is a giant moth wtf  For example when I first went on /r/WTF today the highest rated ones were 'The Power of Polka' and 'The toad in my mothers pond keeps eating birds' The Polka one was just a dog dancing, to me it wasnt WTF it was more, huh thats kind of funny/odd/random. The toad swallowing a whole bird to me is definitely WTF. Dont know if everyone agrees with that reasoning. I do believe that if you click on something in /r/WTF it should make you say "Ive never seen something that strange WTF" WTF should be one notch below /r/spacedicks.  WTF is not surgery pictures. We already know there will be blood in surgeries, it's not surprising. WTF sometimes is pure gore..i think simple gore should be relegated to /r/gore i get real tired of injuries. i understand they are shocking to people naturally, but is that really wtf? injuries are pretty straight forward... i.e. 'yes that is what your hand would look like if you put it through a saw.' 

i'd like to see more strange or weird instead of shocking I think there should be an NSFL tag for posts. I can't even count the multitude of times i have clicked an untagged or tagged post with some sort of stupid title and seen someone dead before the mods get to it and lable it. I didnt subscribe to watch someone die or look at dead bodies. To me personally its more disturbing than just wtf. On the topic of gore, if someone just has a terrible wound or something, then maybe it should just be posted to r/gore. But I'd like to see posts if it's a picture of an unorthodox procedure, or something gone wrong, or an injury gotten in a way that makes you say wtf.  Im very glad that the mods are addressing this issue. I believe that /r/wtf should have pictures of disturbing, unexpected, discusting, things with mild to moderate gore. Some of those things would be funny as well as discusting, unexpected, ect... but I'm just tired of posts of mildly odd things that should easily be in /r/pics WTF to me is What The Fuck?! Maybe not always gore, or anything creepy. But really just a picture that makes you look at it a little longer, thinking "Wait.. I mean.. What?! What the fuck is that?" /r/wtf should be just that  makes you say WHAT THE FUCK !! 90% of the shit thats  been posted in /r/wtf as of late has no business being here and the people posting it should be banned   The old WTF needs to return. This sub was once my favorite, I would come here to exclaim "WTF?!"  But now I'm just left with posts of cars with moderately bad paint jobs or some awkwardly dressed person. /r/fiftyfifty has become more WTF than this. Just scroll back like 4 months ago. That was wtf. The gore is fine if it was done in an odd situation but there is always r/gore if you want to see that stuff and the public exposure are amazing and quite funny but not always WTF worthy. The "cruelty to animals" posts truly churn my guts. I noticed "these girls put a kitten in a microwave" and "this is the 2nd post this guy has made of him feeding live cats to is dogs" and couldn't look at it. I, personally see WTF as things that are bizarre, gross, humanly impossible (with varying results), but really get upset when I see people do intentional harm to animals or kids. (the kids vimeo with the three little hood rats beating on the unattended toddler on a 3 wheeler got me riled up also.) There is no place for intentional cruelty to gain attention, or points on any scale. If we wanted to see faces of death we'd watch THAT right? I can handle 95% of WTF content without batting an eye, but you see people hut things for fun, it seems like these people should be held accountable. Maybe the news story on how these assholes got CAUGHT, but propagation of their content just seems foolish and immoral. Random dead person or broken arm is stupid. Guy with car keys through his forehead is wtf. what the fuck is better than wow that's fascinating  Rule 10. Gore and porn are not **DEFUALT** WTF.

But *some of it does belong here.* A motorcycle wreck pic where guy gets road rash so bad it rips his backside off and dies? /r/WTF approved!

 Same pic captioned, "LMFAO!," or, "At least I was wearing a helmet..." See /r/ImGoingToHellForThis 

If the WTF civil war doesn't stop, it will fall from the front page like /r/atheism 

/r/WTF was the first /r/FiftyFifty in my book! Great posts all round tame, lame, or even to much Al Gore. If someone bitches to the mods that they don't like it, politely ban them and suggest they go to /r/spacedicks, /r/cute, /r/cats, /r/findareddit depending on the content of their bitching.

And maybe it should... /r/WTF might be a better sub if it weren't default. I would make sure to put it on my sub list if it stayed just as edgy and/or sometimes "tame". If it changes to the light or dark side there will just be a new sub like /r/TRUEWTF or /r/WTFwasIthinking each filled with all gore or just spiders respectively. 

**TL;DR: I vote keep WTF the same and on the front page.** [Haters gonna hate](http://curiousinkling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/haters-gonna-hate-07.jpg)

I know I am very late with my opinion but I hope it helps. What is WTF is different for different people, it's subjective.  The complainers need to shut up and make use of the downvote arrow.  Both sides. Can we at least insist on a flag for gore? Some days I can take it, other days not so much.  How about less deaths/murders.  Leave that stuff for /snuff.  Gore is fine but leave out the gifs of people getting shot in the back of the head.   Personally, I think there is still too much /r/gore showing up here....

As I read here once: leg with a compound fracture = /r/gore, compound fracture with a clown humping the other leg = /r/wtf....or something along those lines, it was a mod that posted it....

tl;dr = still too much /r/gore in /r/wtf How about the mods get more active and delete stupid shit like "Look the painters painted over a penny!" and bad parking jobs and any fucking bug that wanders into OP's field of vision. 

This used to be my favorite sub, now it's just pathetic. Looks more and more like /r/Im12andIveNeverSeenThisBefore I've never heard anyone ever say wow that's fascinating as wtf. So I think that has to go. Some people mentioned injuries and said they should go. However, you don't often see injuries like that. If you were to see some of these in person you would definitely go wtf. So we should think "if I were in that situation would I think it's wtf?" IF the answer is yes it should stay. If no then obviously it can go. Someone's [chopped up hands](http://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f10/89899d1251837200-mutilated-hands-feet-dedo2.jpg) I would say is wtf. Someone with [slightly cut up](http://mysticsail.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dizzy-cut-hand-web.jpg) but not mutilated hands is not wtf worthy.

edit: here's a list of things that should and shouldn't be here that are posted

stuff that shouldn't be posted
[interesting but not wtf this belongs in r/pics](http://imgur.com/a/Ef91b)
[Yes we get it rotten food, most of us have seen something like this, it's not really that bad. Just go back and get another one](http://i.imgur.com/1MfTtzn.jpg)

Here is a list of questionable wtf which we give the benefit of doubt

[no clue about this one but utter stupidity might be worthy](http://i.imgur.com/3yFj3VS.jpg)

Now for the truly wtf. Stuff that when you see is undeniably wtf(stuff that is laugh out loud wtf or disgusting wtf or surprise wtf)
[cow face](http://24.media.tumblr.com/fd9fbfaef1da0bf0bb0382ae1101b4b7/tumblr_mk07qntKGr1qe8h41o1_250.gif)

[creepy artists don't need an explanation](http://imgur.com/a/t7lcL?1)
[ a severed rotting foot is worthy of wtf](http://i.imgur.com/eGLyEOH.jpg) &gt; Please voice your opinion on what /r/wtf should all be about.

It should be about the appalling, disturbing and alarming.

It should not be about personal tragedies or outrages.

Examples of what is WTF:

* Flagrant and appalling situations
* The unexplainable
* The disturbing, grotesque and horrific

Examples of what is not WTF:

* The restaurant flubbed your food
* The latest news from Syria
* Someone did something mean/stupid
* Someone pooped on the floor A WTF for one person may not be a WTF for another. Everyone has different "filters" when it comes to what makes them say "WTF?!?" IMHO, I think there is too much complaining from people regarding whether or not a NSFW tag has been posted and I too have seen the "I'm with family members!" complaint. Listen. You are browsing "WTF". What do you expect? Anyway, I would one do thing when it comes to "WTF" and that would be to tag /r/wtf as NSFW, in general and if necessary, tag it with "gore" "porn" "death" etc. I'm just so sick of seeing people cry about why something isnt NSFW. It's WTF, people. What are you expecting? I think WTF should mainly be about What the F***, since WTF is mainly recognized for that. Besides, Wow, That's Fascinating could go indifferent subreddits, such as TIL. I feel like it should be a less extreme version of spacedicks I like the strange and bizarre things. The gore bothers me.  I'm pretty content with the things that are posted here on a daily basis. MY opinion compared to *your* opinion on WTF will be totally subjective. I think the sub right now captures a vast area of "wtf" things. If I don't want to see it, I won't look at it.  Dead people and pictures of people whose lives are irreparable should be marked as NSFL. 
We know how NSFW works, so we're fine there. 
Gore needs a "gore" tag. 
Interesting WTFs (not gross, but make you go "WTF") should be marked as "safe". 
Disturbing posts marked as "disturbing". 

SOMETHING to keep the dead people out of my view right before I go to bed. Gore and other stuff I can handle, but a dead person tag would save my dreams the following night.  [deleted] The things that I hate seeing are the posts where its like "OMG! This person is out living their life in a different manner than I would live my life! WTF!" Like, for example, the old guy wearing a two-piece bikini at the beach that was on the front page yesterday. Or, just things that OP has personally not seen before but are actually pretty commonplace- "WTF?!?! That's a thing I haven't seen before!!" And, to the people saying "Just downvote it!" I do. Every day. Almost every front page post. Doesn't seem to be helping. Things that make you shudder, cringe, or question the existence of the subject posted. A grocery store cashier with long fingernails? No. More "what in the actual fuck?' than "HOLY SHUT IM GONNA PUKE" I think WTF should be full of slightly to very disturbing things. Anything that audibly makes me say "Whoa, what the fuck?"
 
While what makes people say WTF is different for everyone, I think we should trim a lot of the posts that are just funny, and not really WTF. Honestly I think it should be something to make you say "what the fuck" and show your roommate Wtf=what the fuck. Basically, when I look at a WTF post, I want my reaction to be like the reddit alien at the top left. This subreddit needs to contain material that actually makes you say "wtf" whether that be gore, porn, or just something really fucked up. That's what I love about this subreddit.  Gore is cool. 

But there's r/gore for that Can you moderate posts without Gore or Death tags? Really, those should be mandatory. Anything that is quite out of the ordinary that makes you say wtf.

You need do have a standard for some sort of odd-o-meter.

Someone growing a horn out of their ear is wtf (though gross).

Someone posting how there pepsi spill looks like the canary islands is not.

 Not WTF worthy : "scary insects", bad parking pics, Photoshopped pics, letters, notes or scribbles, broken bones, animals killing animals, racial bigotry. 

WTF worthy : a photo of an object or person or scenery that would automatically make you say "What The Fuck!?". As for gore, if the injury is extremely rare and shocking then maybe, but remember NSFW tag.

Edit: shortened
 WTF should be crazy things that have no rational explanation.

Gore?  It's just what happens when people get injured.  No WTF there.
 WTF is just fine the way it is....some people just like to bitch It's like porn. One man's ho-hum swimsuit issue is another mans lusty wicked perversion. You can't satisfy everyone-- so stop trying. /r/wtf is a great subreddit and if I click on a spider, or a guy with a nail thru his eyeball, well so fucking what. I click off it and move on. If it tickles my wtf meter then hooray for me. But to control content you have to control subscribers -- and then its not fun anymore. Leave /r/wtf alone! I think WTF is completely arbitrary.  What makes me WTF is different than what someone else will WTF to.  

Some gore is WTF.  Some completely work safe stuff is WTF.

I think we can all agree this isn't /r/forwardsfromgrandma, and should keep that from happening. I love /r/WTF, but yeah.  Maybe only 10% or 15% of the time am I seeing something that really makes me think "WTF?!"  And I mean in a way I expect to be thinking when I come here.  Earlier today I said "WTF?!" to [So My Friends Cat Wanted to Play](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1ma6dj/so_my_friends_cat_wanted_to_play/) because *seriously*, that shit is not what this board should be about.  WTF is it doing here?

This is what I imagine /r/WTF to be:

**Completely Unexpected and/or Uncommon Shit** - A gif of some pedestrians getting hit and/or killed by a car?  That's not WTF.  Some pedestrians getting hit and/or killed by a car, the driver gets out and is apparently wearing a clown suit...he gets into an argument with one of the people he hit...a fist fight occurs before he runs off and gets hit by an ambulance?  I think that can qualify.

What annoys me or I get tired of...

First:  [Picks photoshopped to be "weird/gross/fucked up" shouldn't be allowed.  Period.  THIS post is a good example.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1mab5s/icky_pop/)  Seriously.  

I feel like a lot of the stuff I click on here ends up being common shit that I feel like would be easy to find, something that the average person has a chance of seeing in their daily life, and easy to google shit.  This is your crazy wal*mart people, spiders, rotten food, a lion trotting around with an animal leg in its mouth, flooding, whatever.  Not really "WTF" material in my opinion.  

**When it comes to medical stuff or gore**, I think there needs to be a clearer distinction of what is and isn't WTF material.  I am tired of seeing people who split their heads open, have a large gash on their arm, or hey...I can see the bones in your feet because of that injury...wow.  I don't think "Ew look at all this blood" automatically makes it "WTF."

The other day someone posted pics of their sinus infection gone horribly wrong.  The infection moved to their tear duct and they ended up growing a large blood sack out of their eye.  Seeing that...in my opinion, that's pretty WTF.

I've had a pretty bad sinus infection that got ugly for me.  Not that people other than me could tell.  I had surgery and had major bruising and swelling because of it.  If I took a photo of my face like that and maybe a pic of what had been in my nose while I was healing.  No.  That would be fucking stupid.  That's not WTF.

Also, I am tired of seeing the results of diabetes and feet.

**Lastly.  I am so fucking sick and tired of seeing shit.  *LITERALLY* SHIT.**  Someone missed the toilet?  Someone wiped shit on the walls?  Someone wrote their name in shit?  Not WTF material.  At all.  Make a post when your friend swallows 5 gold fish whole and four of them are mostly intact and visible in his shit in the toilet.  Geezus.

I will shut up now. Taking photos of "weird" people without their permission is cruel, and almost never WTF. It's simple. Put in the put title what it is. Tag your shit if there's gore, nastiness, etc. If we all just follow the rules we have now, people wouldn't see shit they didn't want to see. I say issue a warning system, or temporary mutes/bans for people who are intentionally not tagging for shock value. Gore isn't WTF, it's just gory. You tripped and gashed your knee - so what? You had surgery? Me too. Big deal. So did a lot of other people. WTF is supposed to be about stuff that makes you actually say "WTF?" not just "EWWWW!". At least put a Gore tag on it. I hate seeing a headline like "Happened at work" and it's some guy's arm with nails shot through it.  Death is OMG, it is not WTF even if it is in a strange way.

Edit: absolutely nothing about any harm to children. It's just to much. Or at least tag this shit.  I think it'd be better if posts could categorised in the title to give people an idea of what's coming.

[GORE]
[ILLEGAL]
[DISGUSTING]
[SCARY]
Etc

I'm thinking better classification rather than pulling posts completely. Everyone will have a different idea of what's WTF to them.

So this might be more workable - for example I'd prefer to avoid gore - but I wouldn't want anyone else to miss out. Siiiiiiiick of seeing people's body fluids, teeth, boogers, poo, stupid scabs etc.  NOT wtf. It's the human body. Shit happens Hi mods thanks for helping to keep r/WTF WTFworthy. I have two requests: First, can we please have some moderation of "Look what my friend found in her food" type posts? Sure, they may make someone who is unfamiliar with this subreddit say WTF, but really there's no way to verify them and there have been so many lately it's impossible take any of them seriously. 

Also, cakes with penises on them are not WTF. These are a very common requests for bachelorette parties and most bakeries will do one every now and then.  Having just seen the "creepy face in my pasta" post on r/WTF, I think perhaps there is no hope for turning this sub around. Perhaps you should start a new WTF sub. Just start from scratch, and be diligent about filtering these fuckers. Just make a new subreddit, like r/wftgore or something like that [THIS](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=30096358) is not WTF worthy! And it's on the front page. If you want to complain about shit, this is not where to do it WTF should be things that are **extremely** unexpected and would make most people say "What the fuck", as in things that make no sense; they defy logic or rational thought. This would include truly bizarre (not just wierd) behavior, and things that appear to defy known and accepted laws of nature.

This does NOT include insects/arachnids and personal injuries.  Wtf should be what the fuck, but going beyond that I feel that these things should be wtf to people with no context. You may come out of a store to find your car on fire and say wtf, but to the rest of the world it's just a car fire, nothing more.  I agree with the notion that disgusting stuff isn't always WTF. For example, when someone posts a picture of a giant piece of shit, I don't think WTF except in the context of "WTF is this asshole doing posting something so stupid and boring".

WTF is stuff that really should not be, or unexpected stuff; stuff which makes me do a double take. A badly broken body or a toilet makes me look once and say "so?". Also, there should be an exclusion for anything which is deliberately WTF, like gifs of people doing something stupid for the sake of being stupid. WTF should be spontaneous. Maybe a sub category of gore, nature whatever. Make it easier to navigate to what thrills each of us? WTF shouldn't *just* be stuff that makes the poster say or think WTF!? but should be something that when posted makes most other people say WTF?! also. What I mean is that it should be something that absolutely does not fit within any sane context. A good WTF should be something that makes you think about it for some time afterward. A really good WTF should alter or possibly shake the foundations of what you previously held to be possible, logical, or likely. Examples would be like Lonesome Cowboy and that pic of the thing Jeff? You know where they hold the weird dude back while they pour milk over a girl in front of him. 

That's **my** opinion anyways. Make it self posts only with a required description of the image/link/etc.  Sure, this takes away that "GOTCHA!" factor, but hey, a severed head is a severed head either way.  This way people have no right to complain about what they're seeing since its been clearly outlined ahead of time. What I would love to see is more labeling in the title, especially for Gore. I have no problem with it being in WTF, as you say, it takes all kinds. I just don't want to get surprised when I click on "Well this surprised me" and find some car crash victim. Just label them so we can pick and choose. Once something goes in through the eyes, it never comes out of your brain. -No animal cruelty or popping. PLEASE. 
-Gore is fine if it's in WTFish context. 
-Srsly, am I alone on the animal cruelty part? I'd really like to know what others think. 
-Later world, smell my ass! Some people made /r/EAF/ (Epic As Fuck) yesterday, I think that would be a good alternative for the kind of posts that are more awesome than unusual; posts we see too much in this sub. Gore should be in /r/gore. "Look at what I stuck my hand in. Isn't that weird?" these posts aren't WTF, at all. If you find something that isn't supposed to happen, that's WTF. I considered the hospital needles much more WTF than the rolled car. You expect the latter to happen.  It is very simple... Look at what you are presented with... Does it make you say (or think) 'What The Fuck...'?

Answer yes: It belongs here
Answer no: It belongs elsewhere racism isnt so wtf.. What makes someone say WTF will vary from person to person, however I feel that things that have a logical explanation are not not WTF worthy.

Optical illusions are not WTF. A car with dough left out in direct sunlight in summer heat, causing the dough to rise an incredible amount in not WTF. A flash flood or natural disaster is not WTF. Extreme swelling due to a bee sting or broken bones are not WTF. Overweight people and hoarders are rarely ever WTF. 

A car filled with with a large amount of bones could be WTF. A flash flood that washed up one ton of exotic sea life on your drive way may be WTF. A transvestite midget with polio tap dancing can possibly pass as WTF, and a little bit creepy.  

Gore and weird porn links are not things I click on so I can't really contribute a whole lot, but I don't feel like they necessarily need to be removed.  Honestly there need to be more NSFW tags. Those are usually the ones that make you say W.T.F.... I think r/wtf is going kinda soft.. If it's not NSFW then it's hardly worth looking at I think everything about the subreddit is great, any content that makes someone say "What the fuck is that" should be allowed. I will say that more people should label NSFW posts with the NSFW tag. I don't like an unassuming title followed by some guy's anus or something. Spammed posts, oh god. WTF is this - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it work time fun If it makes you wanna barf or makes you think or say out loud what the fuck, its fair game I believe that it is very difficult to decide what is pertinent, as different people say WTF ti different circumstances.  I used to holy-WT-actual-F a lot on this sub, but now I'm more like "meh".  

Ultimately, I think the only way to resolve this is for the mods need to trust in the voting system and let the interwebs decide what is relevant to the WTF culture of reddit.  If you don't like gore, don't fucking click.  If you feel like dwarves armed with pick axes chasing a downs baby in a wheelchair is /r/mildlyinteresting, use the voting system.

That's all I have to say about that. We should have gore, strange porn, and gross medical oddities. Maybe there should be a separate "tame" subreddit called just "what?" or something for things that are odd, but not truly WTF. I think some people post here because they see something unusual and don't know where else to post it. 
I think there should be GROSS category to cover all the wound pictures. If  i dont bleed poop it wasnt wtf worthy. Less people posting a picture of a single medium sized spider.  Add flair to indicate the level of gore, or type of wtf. So for gore based wtf, have "g" followed by a number 1-10. For other types, go "how" "why" "wow" and the like.  WTf should make you feel like "how in the world is that possible" Really, the porn needs to stop. A guy rubbing sh** all over his dick well masturbating should be in r/gag. It doesn't make me wtf, it makes me gag. Same thing goes for the crustacean vagina, again, gag. Not wtf. What the fuck should be things that actually make me say What the fuck! When I see them. more prolapsed anuses!  Prolapsed anuses for all!
 I dont care what it is, as long as it makes me say.."what.. the... fuck"...
 Anything that makes anyone say what the fuck. That is very broad. That is a huge encompassing definition. Quite frankly, anything can make you say what the fuck. Thats fine. THAT is what this subreddit is. I want to be surprised with something thats gross, nude, fucked up, twisted. And sometimes a picture of a cat in a weird position is fine for me. It doesn't need to be nailed down to a specific.

PS: If something isn't tagged "NSFW" this is /r/WTF, assume it is. Browse /r/funny at work and gtfo!  WTF can be interpreted as you say, in many ways but the problem is that the redditor who thinks WTF is when their bus ticket was a different colour one day, and those that think nothing is WTF unless someone died or has their intestines exposed are two diametrically apposed view points.

I think that the thread is self regulating.   You like it,Upvote, you dont, downvote and I for one would choose to download posts that are not appropriately posted.  What I think as a reader is WTF is not important because it is the poster who determines whether they think its WTF.

If I see a post titled *"Look what I found in my chicken dinner"* then I dont click it because I know its going t be someone inaccurately identifying the chickens kidney as its brain.

If a title says *"Cleaning out my Grandmothers base ment and found this"*  I will sometimes click on it, sometimes not.

If I see a title *"Onelegged man cruising around he sexshop on a pogo-stick with a feret hanging out his arse"*  I will click it.

Basically the title determines whether I will click it.

Allowing and not allowing content is "Nanny stating" Reddit.
Some people are frustrated when they click on something they don't think is WTF or that is a re-post and let loose on the Poster.  Thats fine too.  Let it happen  everyone will be OK in the end.

I come here for the variety and I will happily cope with anything that manages to make it on here that is not strictly my definition of WTF to maintain the variety.  Dont let us start flinging new laws and restrictions around.  Rules Rules rules is the first steps to the slippery slope of fundamentalism.

My one suggestion would be that Moderators could add an additional subtitle (identified as a moderator label) to the title if its incorrectly labeled or doesn't identify clearly what the post is.

One last thing.  What I find really frustrating is when a Redditor is so incensed at a repost (presumably because it wastes their time) that they then waste more time compiling and submitting a list of re-posts.
 If you have to squint at something, turn your laptop sideways, call your SO to take a look, and you still aren't sure what you're looking at... that is wtf worthy. I agree with other posters that the gore, injuries, and spiders just don't belong.  I feel it doesn't matter what it is even gore as long as it makes you say WTF. Like someone said earlier, if you put your hand in a meat grinder and you end up ground that's not WTF. If you are filing your nails and the nail file breaks and you stab yourself with it. That's WTF. Or if you are driving and the person in car next to you has bloody hand prints all over their car, that's WTF.  It's WHAT THE FUCK not oh wow or omg . If it doesn't have at least some of the shock that makes you question the nature of humanity then i don't think it's WTF. Also, i feel like at it's best WTF is a place of irreverent gallows humor, a horrific news story IS the perfect occasion for a joke . U Know , Context. 
 gore is a big no no for me. if theres gore, put it in the gore subreddit. thats what the gore subreddit is for. hence the name r/gore.

reactions i want are "lol wut?" and "what the fuck" and less "eww" Strange things that make you say the words. People get hurt all the time. A picture of your brother with a big gash in his leg from a bike accident doesn't make me say the words. I've had quite enough of that bullshit. If you can look at a post, and it has an explanation, it's not wtf. For example, posts like "My friend stuck his hand in a lawnmower" followed by a pic of his butchered hand, that's not WTF. That's what happens when you stick your hand in a god damn lawnmower. Cause, effect. A good example of WTF would be three chicks fucking pigs wearing gas masks that are hooked up to dudes assholes. If its just three chicks fucking pigs, that's not wtf, that's beastiity. Or like pics of deranged motherfuckers and the schizophrenic notes they wrote to their voices. Not this "Some dude double parked, wtf man" or "hey look people are fucking across the street, here's a pic" I am probably way late to this thread but can we get people to stop posting old KKK and Nazi propaganda? They're relics of their respective time periods. If you know anything about history it shouldn't be WTF to you. First of all, what the hell has happened in the past two months or so?  I know that /r/wtf has been gradually going downhill for a while now, but in a small time frame it has pretty much instantly turned into /r/pics.

WTF = What the fuck.

I don't think pictures of casual injuries (a picture of a dislocated knee, for example) or minor bug bites should be allowed.  I don't think people parking shittily should be allowed.  I don't think pictures of bugs should be allowed.  Photoshopped pictures, pictures of receipts, overdecorated cars, well-known street performers (such as the naked cowboy), topless women just standing around being topless, tattoos, cute pictures of baby animals... none of this is WTF.  And it's all 80% of the posts from the last month. I am so sick of nature posts.  They're not wtf, they're nature.  You saw a spider, big fucking deal, go post it in /r/spiders.  You saw a teacher form that came home with your kid?  Go post in /r/nobodygivesafuck.  You saw and 18 wheeler careen across the freeway and take out a schoolbus, then it exploded?  Hell yes, post that shit here. I have a few. 

I have been browsing this sub for about 2 and half years. Because it was a default sub when I joined reddit. And since day 1 I've been seeing shit like. Wtf happened to /r/wtf? I'm bringing wtf back!! Then posts a mutilated body or whatever. I don't know what it was before but I get the idea. 

I'm definitely not a prude or some shit but I think the porn and gore should go. 

Porn. A person with two fists in their ass or whatever I don't think is wtf. Anyone can do it if you know what I mean. 

Gore. Broke your arm and now it hinges at the forearm? Yeah that'll happen. It's obvious. Doesn't make me go WTF!! 

Big scary insects. Yes they exist. And unless you've just discovered a new species it's been well documented before. Not at all wtf. 

Shitty parking job. Yep see it all the time IRL. 

It's hard for me to see what this sub is SUPPOSED to be cos I haven't been browsing since its beginning but I do know it's probably the most conflicting sub on reddit. 

Maybe you, the mods, instead of asking should tell us what it's meant to be?  The reason why there is so much non-WTF posts, is because people say what the fuck for everything. "what the fuck my waiter gave me diet coke and I asked for mountain dew." 

What should be posted is things that make you go "WOAH WHAT THE FUCK". 

If you don't think WOAH, just GO.  Ex: an obese woman wearing only a tube top standing on the corner is not WTF.. If said woman was remaking "two girls one cup" while standing on the corner.. This would work.. 
A lot of posts in wtf are strange clothing choices... Who cares what people wear???? This does not belong in this subreddit.  Wtf should be about something you don't expect or something that isn't natural or normal!  Even though gore is nasty, if you cut off a foot, it's normal that your leg is gonna look grose, blood is natural! Also a strange animal in nature isn't wtf, it's normal it's nature! Also something that apears a littel strange isn't wtf, like when someone uses a fork to eat soup, it's strange but not something anyone couldn't do to pose just for the picute to get reddit carma! WTF is a guy eating his poop or a pineapple falling from the sky! Something thats not natual and can't be found around the corner! Im more than happy to see the gore as long as it actually makes you say WTF.  http://i.imgur.com/vYvoGpH.jpg not what the fuck worthy. 

[NSFW] http://i.imgur.com/Jl4uFFC.jpg completely worthy.

And I'm sure the majority would like the mods to flex their power more. Yeah you might butt hurt a small percentage, but the majority will be grateful.  Something that makes me say wtf as a reaction  I prefer what the fuck. There are subs for things that are interesting, like /r/woahdude /r/mildlyinteresting and /fuckthatsinteresting . What the fuck is for either shocking images that make us squirm, or pictures that have no explanation that makes us wonder "how did they get in this position?" I honestly miss the gore thrown in.  It's a nice break every once in a while, but /r/gore can be too much. I miss the way it used to be.  If you don't make the /r/wtf alien face when you look at it or watch it, it shouldn't be here. The tame and stupid shit needs to go. I think less gore, more weird.  I think gross belongs here as well as extreme scare, creepy, and uncomfortable.   "WTF is happening here" can be just as WTF as gore or poop or whatever. I think you should just have filters like /r/wheredidthesodago. One for mild, one for gore, and one for nsfw, and so on, so people can filter out specific things they don't want to see. That way people would only look at what they think is WTF to them, and there'd be no more complaining. Please post this questionnaire again next weekend to be perfectly honest, ive been subscribed here for 2+ years, and this place has went from, "what the hell is going on here?" and "how the hell did this happen" to "huh, thats a mild taboo from my everyday life." and the most unsurprising and un-WTF can get 1000+ karma. it has become a place of finding unsatisfactory details and being anything but "WTF". personally, i believe gore should be allowed, and marked. its okay because this is a NSFW subreddit. i believe this subreddit needs some better rules and mods The posts where someone got undercooked chicken is not WTF or the posts where a bug was in their salad, it happens move on. I personally think the articles people post about fucked up shit people do, I find that to make me say what the fuck. My opinion. lol people feel strongly enough to message you guys?  Seriously, it's not that big of a deal... LESS INSECTS.  I sit on this sub a lot. The one thing that really makes me say WTF is when something completely random and completely fucked up i.e (Random landslide rock almost hitting car on the side of a mountain, or a cellphone being pooped out of a camels ass) that is what WTF is all about. 

Random side not: Has a camel ever pooped out a cellphone? Has it ever been on Reddit? Minions....go forth. Can we also stop rotting carcass posts?  WTF can be a bad fact or a good fact . You seem something amazing that u cant believe, that is wtf worthy. Too much gore/death and no amazingness I'm inclined to suggest that if you are getting complaints that "things are too gory" and "there's not enough gore", that you are probably you are probably in the right area, and the people who are complaining are in the wrong room.  Also, there are so many subs, that most of us aren't even aware of, things are bound to pop up on other subs before, or after they appear here.  I'm pretty much fine the way WTF sits right now.  I think there is a lot of stuff on here that falls below the standard, but I've seen tattoos, hair styles, car accidents, mutations and so on and so on that literally made me say "what the fuck?" to myself.  I would suggest, as well, that this post, and some gentle chiding from other readers should assist in people thinking about what they post, and slowly move them to more suitable subs. People just need to stop upvoting bullshit.
I have noticed a steady increase in bullshit here lately... I'm happy with /r/wtf's current offerings. I come here mostly to get a hodgepodge mixture of everything.  WTF should be What The Fuck _only_.  I come here to be appalled and surprised.  I don't come here to see this shit:

http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1lhuq1/these_signs_were_placed_on_dorm_buildings_on/  
http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1klxui/i_see_your_grandmothers_watermelon_noose_and/  
http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1kcj97/googled_great_white_shark_this_came_up/  
http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1j3nio/unfortunately_there_were_none_of_these_monsters/  

etc. This is my most browsed subreddit. If I click on a post and don't say 'what the fuck..?' Then it gets a downvote. No ifs, ands, or buts. That's simply what this needs to be. Make me say what the fuck out loud or go somewhere else. I know we're a community but this is r/WTF.. Like.. Its in the subreddit name. Gore, creepy shit, scary shit, horrible/unique life experiences. Just make us say wtf and this subreddit will be doing its job Can you make it so people have to actually include a decent description or anything related to the post not just "I don't even know what to say" or "WTF". I get tired of clicking on things that have no title or a terrible title and it shows something I would prefer not to look in which I wouldn't have if it had a good title. To be etc a thing must be strange. It must be weird, confusing, or out of place. When I see a wtf thing, I wonder in my head how or why that insanity came to exist. 

It commonly overlaps with the gross, with porn, or with an injury. I am very much not in favor of banning all injury/ porn/ whatever posts. But I would say that "I fell off my bike, now my ankle is broken" is not wtf, while "I fell off my bike and landed on something strange" is. why would you come on /r/WTF if you didn't want to see fucked up shit? I for one like the gore in this subreddit. obviously it's better if the gore is a little more wtf worthy such as a guy managed to stick a pencil through his skull. the balls albumns were definitly wtf worthy in my opinion and also just plain gory. 

What I really dislike more than anything is the tame stuff.

 also, about the gore, for most of us gore is often wtf worthy because we truly don't see that stuff often in real life unless you work in the ER
 My #1 complaint: pics of animals.  If the animal is doing something bizarre, fine.  But we all know that weird looking animals exist.  So what?  That is absolutely not wtf. if something is funny, it's not WTF worthy.  "what the fuck" seems to be the popular version. most of what's in here is gore, random or freaky. a "wow, that's fascinating" is more of r/TIL rather than r/WTF. Can we all fucking safely agree that spiders are not wtf worthy. Neither are ingrown toenails, bruises, wasps, notes left on doors or car windows, rotten food your flatmate left in the fridge for a month, excrement on a bathroom floor or "creepy" dolls found in the woods? Please? A WTF post show literally have me saying those words. If there is a comment in a thread saying that that specific post is not WTF, and it has more upvotes than the thread itself, then I think the thread should be removed.  I am bored of the gore. Gore is usually not WTF, it's usually a predictable result from some negligent action.

* "My skater friend fell and broke their arm" - not WTF.
* "Guy killed on lathe" - not WTF (unless he was trying to fornicate with it whilst it was running)
* "I had a car crash, I walked away" - jolly good, welcome to crumple zone and engineering. Unless there is something *unusual* about the crash, it's not WTF.

I have nothing against gore (although it's not nice to look at) but it's not WTF. WTF should make you go "What. The. Fuck.?" A man dressed as a zebra with a strap-on dildo bouncing down the street on a pogo stick? **That's** WTF! I think mods need to be careful about over moderating. I am a mod myself (under a different u/) and think the most important thing to be done is to remove spam, then the upvotes/downvotes take care of the rest. Reddit can be really annoying when you have to read a page of different rules before every submission in different sub.

I think r/wtf runs great as is. If I had to make one rule, however, to make this sub personally tailored toward me, I'd say no gifs in which a person actually dies. That can be too disturbing for days, and is not respectful to the deceased living family. WTF Should always awoke a feeling, a sense of "Wow" with a prefered tilt towards "Wow what the fuck". 

Be it morbid, death, stupid shit, people, whatever.

I've been visiting this place a lot and 90% of posts are mildly interesting or people voicing their own personal phobias as if it was "WTF" (Just look at the amount of reposts of spiders... I fucking love spiders.).

**My rules would be as follows:**

Regardless of your own subjective feeling, objectively thinking to the utmost ability of your mind; Would OTHERS consider this or view this as "WTF"? Would their spontaneous thought be "wat" or "de fuc?" etc. I think /r/wtf needs to be more like how it used to be. Pictures that were so shocking, horrible or just generally fucked up that they invoked a genuine "WHAT THE FUCK?!?" reaction. With these types of pictures the only reaction possible is WTF unlike many of the pics that should just be posted in /r/mildlyinteresting or /r/pics.  /r/wtf should be anything gore and NSFW. We have plenty of other sub-reddits for the less violent/racey things and subs for the more hardcore stuff too.

tl;dr - Anything you can legally show in a middle school classroom doesnt belong in /r/wtf. Personally I like seeing the gore and whatnot. If you don't want to see gore, don't click things which say Warning: Gore. That simple. Don't change it for everyone else. I think gore, nsfw, blood, or any of the other tags are easy to add and should be used a bit more often but I don't feel that things should limited in wtf  More gore please. what. the. fuck. 
seriously, thinking wtf means "wow, that's fascinating" reminds me of when everyone's mothers thought lol meant "lots of love" If you dont want to see gore..dont get on WTF......what else do you think could be in this category.  I say leave it!

If people don't it too gory or tame they can take their asses back to queertown. 😑 So WTF is defined by a mod now? Now that's a new low. Terrible. This is the best subreddit on the site I wouldn't change a thing.
 I always thought the point of wtf was to make you say what the f#### once you opened the link. How about the following hard rule: If it's on YouTube, it does not belong here. I'd say if I say 'what the fuck' out loud, it belongs here. But usually those things that are clearly tame jokes belong on /r/funny. Look at the little freaked out Snoo in the top left corner.  That's what our reaction should be when we open a pic here. 

By nature, most of these things are going to be NSFW, but they all should be shocking.  A freaky looking spider is not WTF, but perhaps one that was able to catch and kill a much larger mammal might be. Gore could be wtf if it is unusual/shocking enough.  It doesn't have to be gore, but when it is, it should be unusual.  There are many subreddits for tame subjects, /r/wtf is not one of them.  Keep it shocking, horrifying, and perhaps traumatizing. This subreddit is the psycho seasoning that keeps my day interesting and maintains my sanity by introducing chaos. Don't neuter it. Personally I don't want to be seeing gore here. Someone a month or so ago posted a picture of someone cutting into their thumb with a little saw or something. If I wanted to see that kind of thing I would subscribe to the gore subreddit.

Someone wtf worthy should be uprising moreso than disgusting a distinction I wish more people had. This subreddit is way to tame. There is a post of a guy who is missing 3/4 lug nuts on his tire that has been upvoted to the top. that is NOT WTF worthy at all. WTF worthy means you actually say "What the Fuck" out loud, not just something out of the ordinary. For me, WTF should be about the out there, the bizarre. It should be something I've never seen before and definitely wouldn't expect, almost like a circus sideshow or Ripley's Believe it or Not, except preferably not fake. Long time WTFer here. I think that gore, and basically every single injury picture that gets posted doesn't belong here. nail gun to the finger on the front page every other day. Now it'd be wtf if he was bowling with the nail still in, or posing for prom pictures with it still in. Bad parking job on the front page, maybe if they were parking in the middle of a parade as the parade was happening it'd be wtf. a picture of a half taxi half police car paintjob, maybe wtf worthy if it was filled like a clown car full of midgets and rotisserie chickens. The people who want to see gore should go to /r/gore..

Edit: I'm not visiting /r/wtf as often as I did before because of too much gore. The funny thing is that a lot of posts get downvoted because they truly make you say "what the FUCK!?".  i dont think there should be a ban of anything. this is what /b used to be. i think people that complain ust need to READ the warning before they open it. it's not like there isnt a bunch of pages to look at. I like this site just the way it is. It's a good mix. No problems here.  Half the shit I see on here is no long even slightly wtf oh a friend got a watermelon as a tip big Fucken deal dude What the fuck should be what is says it is, What the fuck. I either want to look at a picture and say what the fuck is that or what the fuck just happened. It doesn't necessarily have to be gory or dicks on spiders whatever, but i want to be shocked, not thrown off my computer but at least a lil woah or yikes. I haven't been a redditor very long but when i first used to come here it was some crazy shit. Maybe i have seen too much but i refuse to believe there isn't material out there that can make me say WTF, I look forward to this sub going back to its roots. Enough to make you do a double take, even though you know you won't want to but you are so shocked that you do anyway If I wanted to see gore, I'd be subbed to /r/gore (a link that shall forever stay blue).

I come here for the inexplicable and incomprehensible. If it's only shocking or disgusting, I don't want to see it. Include irony. Actual irony... like a fire station burning down.  That's WTF.  Uncanny: beyond what is normal or expected.  It should be 'what the fuck'. 'Wow that's fascinating' should be left for main page. I'm stuck of seeing wow that's fascinating on wtf. Wtf?! To me WTF is something that makes you scratch your head and ask yourself why? Why? Why? It want to make you ask why not just get grossed out. For example, if someone posted a picture of a potato growing in a vagina, I wouldn't be just grossed out, I would want to know why that person left it there for that long.  I think wtf is different to everyone I love the diversity on wtf and browse it everyday if you're unhappy with a post oh well there's tons of other posts to look through jeeebus just click next no reason to bitch 

Edit:spelling WTF is anything that can be WTF-inspiring, if you think it's WTF-inspiring, this is why we have social moderation and don't really need you mods to be nitpicking fuckwads. go away and leave us alone, this is our subreddit and we are kicking you out.

All we need you to do is keep out the really bad stuff that belongs in the worse subreddits and not here, or in /r/funny. Note the reddit logo for WTF.
It pretty obviously has nothing to do with fascinating or tame.
 I think that it should be more or less about things that are so random and strange that you can't but help to say WHAT THE FUCK
 I feel /r/wtf should be a calmer version of /r/spacedicks, not /r/ohwowthatswierd although weird gore should be accepted, its not the sole point of this board. **As a regular viewer**: The content that should be posted here should be something that makes you say or think "Wow wtf...?"

That being said, if you see something you don't agree with **Downvote it** and vice versa for good posts.

**To the mods**: I think you're doing a great job and the sub is fine as is. It's important to remember that generally those who are satisfied or happy with this reddit are less likely to message you than those who are not. I'm sure the majority of subscribers are pleased with how things are going. Doesn't wtf typically have gore? Isn't that what the warning is for? I think some people may have a sandy vagina. Every post here should make you not want to click on the link, but then youre like, Awwww shit. Lemme just click on it once. And then your retina burn Maybe we should label the post WTF: Title of Post.  I think a lot of shit gets upvoted because people don't pay attention to what sub it is.  They look and note something is interesting or funny and don't realize that it was submitted to /r/wtf instead of /r/funny. I don't like posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1mjq89/no_cheating/)(SFW) on here. If I'm not sure if I'm reading /r/WTF or /r/funny, then I think something's wrong.  If people are complaining about gore, why not make a /r/gore?  That'll keep the people who don't want to see it able to avoid it, while the ones who do, can subscribe. With regards to the gore, I agree that there's way too much of that on WTF, but not because it may put some people off. The problem is that all gore is hard to see, but not all gore is WTF and I think a lot of people can't tell the difference. I'll use two front page posts as my examples: [Someone's toe being half severed](http://i.imgur.com/FOLch4v.jpg) is a horrible injury, but beyond that it's fairly unremarkable. This type of injury can happen by myriad unfortunate means - something heavy like a free-weight or a keg falls on it, a work-related hazard, a particularly pissed off dog etc. As such, it's a relatively common injury. On the other hand, [someone's thumb being pulled out by the root](http://i.imgur.com/dKGdU2q.jpg) and left dangling there, is far less common and hence much more worthy of an upvote. The problem seems to be that most people cringe hard at anything upsettingly gory regardless of whether or not it is truly remarkable and gore posts seem to automatically make the front page, regardless of their quality. Consequently I think we need stricter moderation on gore. 

TL,DR: Not all gore is WTF, mods need to be a little stricter on this. Yes. Gore. I don't mind the occasional injury, like a moose through the windshield, or a gif of a sport injury in slow mo. Those can stay. 
Nullos. That was FUCKED UP. Also, can stay. That is a unique gore, not just your older brother's compound fracture from parkour. Srsly, your brother is an idiot.

Yes. Creepy secret spaces - Always up for hideaways in crawlspaces

No. http://i.imgur.com/5muU6yq.jpg This is NOT WTF. NO. Mildly interesting? 

No. A kid with crazy hair and makeup. I've seen them here, although not too frequently. Teenagers experimenting with their image is COMPLETELY NORMAL. 

Yes. Medical Oddities that would fit in the Mutter Museum. Usually someone has an explanation and it ends up being both WTF and educational, and those are my favorite posts. A little late, but, the "Wow, that's fascinating!" part is for /r/mildlyinteresting. It is the total opposite of the expected.  Personally I would argue the content needs to be shocking or befuddling. For example, looking at today's front page. The crazy flying deer accident or the fat, naked, Estonian covered in ants would be WTF. Meanwhile the guy whose ceiling caved from water damage or the guy who ordered the McEverything are not WTF. WTF should be about the unexpected or the unbelievable. I feel taking gore out of the picture for the sake of a few people defeats the purpose. I enjoy browsing through WTF and seeing things I have not seen in real life- not in a sadistic sense, but the idea that I was able to experience and feel empathy for another being- the cow who was hit by a train for example. I had no idea that anything like that was possible. I feel we should  keep it "what the fuck" I mean, the name of the subreddit automatically denotes a sense of maturity and an understanding  is necessary. The content is not for children. call me crazy, but would opting out of default sub status help to keep posts' success limited to people who are only interested in wtf worthy content?  I left /r/wtf a bit ago because most of what I've been seeing looked more like '/r/funny' material than /r/wtf material. 

I recently heard about this discussion, so here's my input.

I've gone through the front page and picked a few posts that 'look more like /r/funny material' and a few that are 'genuinely /r/wtf' material.

* /r/funny material

&gt; * [Found this on my newsfeed.. a note posted to my friend's neighbor's porch](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1mr7fn/found_this_on_my_newsfeed_a_note_posted_to_my/)
&gt; * [My mom makes cakes. She just sent me this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1mpwv7/my_mom_makes_cakes_she_just_sent_me_this/)
&gt; * [One of those 'Why?' tattoos](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1mqx5d/one_of_those_why_tattoos/)

* genuine /r/wtf material

&gt; * [I don't know man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1mqv6z/i_dont_know_man/)
&gt; * [All of a sudden my shoes are feeling tight on me](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1mqkuu/all_of_a_sudden_my_shoes_are_feeling_tight_on_me/)
&gt; * [This is the creepiest cat i have ever seen. It looked like one of his eyes was a marble.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1mr1ld/this_is_the_creepiest_cat_i_have_ever_seen_it/) Lets also get rid of "I burnt my hand today"
Everyone knows what it looks like. Nobody is wtf-ing I feel like if it made OP say wtf, it works! I always find myself saying WTF?!?!?!? On here. Keep it up I'd say make a sub Reddit to WTF where pictures with nudity of Penis and Vagina pics go. I'm not against seeing that, but sometimes that's a different WTF then why I came to WTF ;) If it makes you say "WTF", post it in r/WTF. IMHO, the level of unbearable-ness should go: r/spacedicks, r/creepy, r/WTF, r/offbeat, r/mildlyinteresting. 

I unsubscribed from WTF because some of the content is too disturbing. But that's OK; if people want to come here to be disturbed, I can go elsewhere. What *really* bugs me is that I went to /r/offbeat as a replacement, and then gore, stories of dead kids, etc. started creeping into there as well. And mildlyintersting is too...mild. WTF am I supposed to do now?
 I thought the premise was pretty obvious. If it makes you say "what the fuck," it's legit. Just because not everyone will have the same reaction as you doesn't make it less legitimate of a post. I imagine someone who regularly deals with gore (soldier/ER surgeon/etc) won't be fazed by a bloody slice down someone's forearm, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be uploaded for those people who DO react to such things. If even one person would say WTF to something, it should be allowed, and if any "hardcore" WTFer doesn't like it, they can go make their own damn site. Reddit isn't here for any one person's enjoyment, it's here for everyone's. Sorry if that means you'll have to engage in a few more clicks here and there. /r/wtf is to be home to things of an anomalic nature to me, that I would find interesting,  like the snake baby, or tree man. Things that would put the normal person outside the ir comfort zone.  It can essentially be about something a post in /r/todayilearned but only if it leaves the normal person saying something like "holy shit" after the post. 

To the people who complain about too much gore, this isn't /r/ratedG.  People who say stuff isn't "wtf enough" are the most obnoxious and biggest babies out there. I find those people turn me off to this site but overall, I say ignore them. If they don't like it, they can vote down, or better yet, click on a different freaking link...   I think people who have boring lives or few life experiences can say WTF at almost everything.  So, I would hope people imagine how another more experienced human would react before posting up what the user alone thinks it WTF.  

I know I think a spider in the bathroom is WTF, being that I am a 13 year old sissy, but would FrostThorn?  I doubt he would because he is the inventor of porn. Just saw that r/wtf will stay the same, I'm glad! I love this sub, it's always my first to check before I go to bed. :) /r/WTF is for things that make you say or want to say "What the fuck?"

Not, huh, that's somewhat strange. That's why /r/mildlyinteresting exists. Honestly who wants to see gore? Not me, I come here to see things that make me say wtf, like something strange not some diseased toe. Who honestly wants to see gore? You must be very disturbed.  WTF should be a subreddit where I really don't want to visit, but I go anyway. WTF should be What The Fuck, from the gory, to the scary, to the down right weird. I wish that outrage/justice news would stopgetting posted as WTF. People do awful things to one another, but it is rarely new or novel or actually WTF. Need more puke. I'm here in hopes of finding SOMETHING(or one) that forces me to throw my phone and freak the fuck out whilst flailing my arms, lapping the living room several times. Two recent highly upvoted posts come to mind. The first is a diagram of the subway system in Tokyo. That is pretty self explanatory why it's absurd to be on this sub. The second is a picture of a German Olympic athlete arrested for dressing as a woman. It's been on several subs and /Wtf is probably the least appropriate place I've seen it thus far. There are countless others but these are two that come to mind.  A mod of WTF who censor a "fuck" in his own post title is making me say wtf Stop the re-posts.. It's too much.. So much of /r/WTF should be in /r/hrmmm. The handicap exit on the second floor, Obama friend chicken, its not wtf, its just "huh, that's odd" It should be renamed to /r/omg When the purist of r/WTF think of this subreddit, they expect r/spacedicks material but always come to disappointment when they reach a post that doesn't comply with their purity view of r/WTF.

What they and most of us seem to forget is that r/WTF isn't all about being covered in shit or typical gore, it's about oddity that a normal being wouldn't normally see in the daily life. That oddity could be creepy, cringing, interesting, or fascinating. Anything that would get you to either say "What the fuck" or "Wow that's fascinating" in your mind can be considered worthy of being posted to this subreddit.

Like I said, r/WTF shouldn't all be about shit and gore. In fact, that isn't how it even started. People saying "bring r/wtf back to its roots" think they're  referring to the violent  preferrer however, they are actually referring to the times when people can post oddities they have encountered without having to require any sense of gore or shit to get upvotes or sensible agreements.

So what is my point? My point is, r/WTF should be about the odd things in the world. Nobody ever said they HAVE to be gored with blood and shit in order for it to be "wtf-worthy", it's the purist of the subreddit that demand that. r/WTF should be a subreddit about odd, wether fascinating, interesting, or disturbing. I agree with the subjectivity of it and side with those that say it's a bit too gorey sometimes, but that would all be okay **IF** there wasn't such a huge grey-area. 

You can't have a post of a decapitation and a penis shaped potato both have the same labelling, i.e. just a NSFW-tag. 

Non-tagged NSFL posts are seriously ruining this subreddit. The mods need to be more active in the "new" section. Also, decapitaions and other extreme gore should just be removed entirely without question, along with everything from the Mexican drug-cartels.  Anything shocking: 
- gore
- weird porn
- unexplainable accidents
- ridiculous hair
- deformities
- rare insects
- things that look like dicks
- diseases
- .gifs that don't make sense
- etc.

It is not for five-year-olds climbing poles, spiders, dog vomit, staples in fingers, lipstick on water coolers, etc. If I open the link and it makes me say "what the fuck" or "Oh, goddamn" or something similar, I upvote it.
It's seriously just that simple. How about we have a system of up and downvoting so that people can decide what they want to see and people stop bitching when things they think aren't wtf-worthy get upvoted Pictures of dead people. Can we blur the faces out of respect at least. I don't necessarily enjoy these but I wouldn't want to be a relative who sees a picture of their loved one on Wtf section. I would like for reddit to be edgy but yet thoughtful.  I come here to look at weird shit and say, "what the fuck!?". 

This does not include gore, which just makes me sad. I don't want to look at it and I don't feel like it fits into WTF - it should be a separate thing. Simply ask those posting Gorey stuff to start the post with the word "Gore:". Then those that don't want to see it can choose not to open it. If there is failure to comply then don't allow it. If I don't feel sick or dizzy, it's not WTF When I first joined reddit, I used to go on /r/WTF and instantaneously shit myself from the different things post, but you know /r/WTF has gone down a notch to the point where WTF has become a Docile WTF Kitty, We need that Tiger spirit back! (This was a reference to the Tiger with Downsyndrome Post.)  So I have one question. How about facebook posts/tweets/etc by stupid people that make you think "What the fuck was that person thinking" or "what the fuck is wrong with that person?" They are usually pretty tame compared to a lot of the stuff people post here and I've seen complaints about them but I just figured maybe that topic should be discussed. As long as gore and the like is marked NSFL I can put up with browsing through a few shitty posts for every good one. No holds barred! Stuff the news wont show! Something that makes me go "WTF", and by WTF I mean WHAT THE FUCK, not Wow, That's Fascinating... I don't come here to be fascinated, I want to be shocked in some way whether it's gore or somebody who accidentally took a shit in their pants at a Dunkin Donuts. I primarily enjoy the latter.   I think it's fine the way it is I wore my seatbelt and survived a car crash, WTF!!!!! /r/WTF should be any and all things that make you say WTF.....isn't that why it's called WTF??  Maybe a bit off topic, but I am god damn tired of seeing gore/death posts not marked as such. I'm so sick of broken limbs being posted here. I mean seriously? I've never seen someone say WTF? to someone wearing a cast. It's just an injury. Then again I miss the days when /r/wtf wasn't /r/gore. I'm just glad that Reddit exists.  I don't get too critical of it. I want all the crazy crap that is too intense for r/unexpected. From NSFL-Death and genital mutilations to massive tumors and douchebag behavior. DON'T CHANGE /r/wtf
 wtf is gore, awful human atrocities, missing body parts and things that make you say "well look at that"  Art pieces (photoshopped images, sculptures, paintings, things designed to create a WTF reaction) do not belong! I hope i'm not too late to the party, but i feel that whatever decision you mods end up making should bear in mind the tradition of /r/wtf. This is a grand old sub with a history and fine tradition of making people sit up in the chairs, go WTF!!? IRL and possibly stop using the internet or have to go off to /r/aww for a short while. The mods really do have a responsibility to start deleting some of this shit which is /r/mildlyinteresting at best and maintain standards.

I'm not in favour of gore for the sake of gore, but it does have its place, just as certain heinous sexual perversions, exotic diseases, and extremely gigantic insects also do. Chopped off my finger in an accident with a saw - NOT wtf. 20 metre long python with a horse in its belly - definitely wtf.

Also, we used to have proper titles and people would know roughly what they were getting into when they clicked the links. Nowadays its stupid shit like "OMG!" Or "what happened?" Lazy shit like this needs to be stopped ಠ_ಠ Leave r/WTF the way it is! If people don't like something they can down vote it, it isn't that complicated, people just need to stop bitching.  I really think recently deceased people videos/pics/gifs etc. need to be ban, it is degrading to the dead and if I was a family member or a friend of a person that was exploited here I'd be very upset about it... Can we keep the death out of this subreddit please?  There are still plenty of vulgar things we can show that are much more civilized than people getting killed. Get rid of the requirement for nsfw tags. If you're enough of a dumbass to view reddit at work or school, you should know the risks and consequences of being here.  Everyone's idea of WTF is different.  I say we leave it as it is. ...Hmm, I personally believe it should be "Wow, That's Fucked up" because we can still see all of this amazing shit other redditors do without it being non gore or mostly gore. Gore, jacked up things in general (unusual insect swarms, hoarders, etc) should define it.

I got no problem with porn if it's actually pretty fucked up (like the Hitler Sucks thing on frontpage of r/wtf atm).

That's IMO. I would like all the posts ill downvote the ones I don't like censorship is the only thing I don't want if you can't handle WTF, unsubscribe or get a job I also agree- if it makes me say "What the fuck!", it's all good. Or sometimes "Holy shit". This is a difficult discussion to have because a lot of wtf is about seeing things that are unexpected or outside of your own world/reality. For me, spiders don't phase me because I've spent a good majority of my life out in the woods. For others, it trips them out because they've been living in the city. 
For me, seeing weirdo fatty's wearing short shorts in the kids section of Walmart trips me out because I never go to Walmart. For others, it's just another typical day. 
So basically, for there to be a fair middle ground, I think the mods either have to keep accepting all of those things I just mentioned (etc.), or be really strict about posting nothing but really mind boggling, nasty shit that is beyond the general population's comprehension  Can we please note, before this gets too popular, that this discussion can, and should, be had politely? This will be much more productive if time isn't spent insulting certain types of submissions, but rather explaining politely why you think they don't belong here.  Wtf should include everything weird strange disgusting and fascinating. Hardcore post are expected. Softer post should be allowed too. As long as it makes you say wtf.  give a "gore" tag over NSFW. people who do this at work are not really worried about the NSFW tag. then people who don't like gore can skip it .. people who post picts of "degloving" accidents can see that if thats what they like.  for me WTF is mostly about surprising situations or GORE. keep the porn stuff down. most of the people over 16 and have been on the internet for more than 2 months have seen the woman pushing a snake out her vagina. make a sub for WTF-Porn. and leave it at that. but truly we need Gore tag.  for me its about reactions. I think the WTF thing fits in posts that surprise you, not hat make you puke. I think there should be (if there isn't yet) a subbreddit for gore things like broken arms an parasites and so on. These things don't make me go WTF?, but they make me go to the bathroom to puke (not really, but I hope you get the point). I like the posts about nature that's wtf'd up. And the gore, and other things that may disturbing. But why can't we have tags for those things?
Nature tags
Gore tags
And some others so people may not complain about what they just saw in /r/WTF. Those that think its to much gore should probably find a new website that better suits their needs. Like Carki said WTF means exactly that WHAT THE FUCK people know what it means when they open the page.  I think that I can either say WTH What The Hell for something weird, but then I can say WTF for something that is like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/LWsb6Wp.png) &lt;--- From /r/WTF today. WTF is for things that shock you.  Things to which you might respond "What the fuck?" I think that screenshots should be able to be posted in some instances. some craigslist/facebook/G+ posts really are quite WTF worthy. I think it should just be something that is decided on by the users whether or not that post makes the cut.  I read this subreddit to see things that surprise me and shock me, make me think "How can someone be so stupid!" or "I didn't know this was possible" or "How can someone seriously do that?". I really do not like to see injuries, feces, rotten things and all the disgusting stuff as long as there is nothing more about it than disgustingness. However, let me add, I'm a tolerant person and we are all different and like different things, so we'll always have content that we like and posts that we don't like. We cannot change that. I like the uncertainty of this subreddit because it could be something from, "oh man that's pretty weird." To, "holy shit I'm gonna throw up." Don't get me wrong there are some posts that suck but that's what the down vote button is for. Please get a better rule about gore. Gore belongs in /r/Gore and injuries belongs in /r/shatter. There's nothing wtf about someone breaking a leg unless it's really *really* wtf. And for gods sake, there is NOTHING wtf about bad parking!  Hey mods, not to sound too harsh, but sometimes dictatorship gets shit done.  Did Steve jobs build apple into an empire because he wanted everyone's input on subjective crap?

No.  He had a vision for what was right and he executed on it.  You guys created / manage this subreddit and have a vision for what it should be.  If you try and meet everyone else's expectations, this subreddit will end up a cluster fuck.

Tell us your vision, your standards, and let up votes and down votes sweat the small stuff.   There's always /r/Im14andthisisWTF  /r/wtf should be about making the veiwer say WTF not make me think oh thats cool. also the i like it when theres a responce to somebody elses post like "you thought your foot was bad" or something like that!
 If there is too much gore, find another sub.  Simple as that.   /r/wtf should simply be comprised of things that make you say "what the fuck?". Simple as that. If it doesn't make you say that, then don't post it. And no, posting pictures of sharks is not /r/wtf material.  If it's remotely funny, it's not WTF. I see too many posts that make me chuckle and then I notice I'm in WTF and get annoyed.  A warning on Gore or insects or phobias would be nice Default subs like /r/WTF are default for a reason.  They're just general catch-alls for nebulously defined content. Because of the high subscriber base, the goal of a default sub is basically to throw as much content at you as possible until some of it sticks.  Some people like gore pics and will only look at those.  Some people like to see birth defects, crazy people being nude in public, and bizarre skin diseases but not gore pics.  /r/WTF is a place where people can browse all of this content, picking and choosing what they want to view, in one neat package.  

Smaller subreddits like /r/unexpected, /r/gore, /r/cringepics, /r/creepy, /r/popping, /r/weird, et al. are all included within the umbrella label of 'WTF?', and really serve only to consolidate specific genres of WTF content for quicker, easier, more accessible viewing for niche audiences, but they aren't there to completely exile that content to a leper colony either (as much as some of those subs might resemble one).  These subs exist so that niche content can thrive, rather than being lost in the noise of other genres.

Because there is plenty of subjective debate--if there wasn't, we wouldn't be having this discussion--as to the definition of what content is 'WTF-worthy' I suggest to the moderators of /r/WTF that we remove the subjectivity out of the phrase entirely.  Establish a unified network of subreddits dedicated to WTF content in much the same manner as the [Shitty Subreddit Network](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyHub) or the [SFW Porn image network](http://stattit.com/user/pornoverlord/) with standardized banners, links, etc, with /r/WTF being the flagship sub.  

Rather than facilitate the ridiculous, schoolyard culture of "My WTF content is more WTF than your WTF content!" by ignoring it, work together with the moderators of the other WTF genre subreddits to highlight their respective fields of weirdness.  Take some of the other valuable suggestions from this thread and define what content is and what isn't appropriate for each subreddit in the network. 

/r/WTF would functionally remain the same catch-all sub that it is currently, just in a more official capacity and without the bickering over definitions.  It can have its own rules for what content should be the primary focus posted there, of course, but it would also be a place for cross-posts and tagged genre posts from the rest of the network can find a more public home.

Above all, though; stay freaky, guys!

Edits: wording, typos. I don't think the problem lies with this subreddit so much as it does with the posters. This reddit is rife with reposts. And I'm not talking about someone reposting content from a few year ago. I mean reposting content from a few minutes/hours/few days ago. And its not 1 or 2 reposts. its 30-40 or more sometimes. This could be easily solved if there was a way to *force* people to check the **hot** tab or use the search function. Also another interesting idea I had was build in some kind of functionality for links similar to karmadecay inside the post function. Before something will actually post have some kind of function "crawl" the content in the post against what has already been posts. Same url comes up? Print message to screen "this has already been posted with time/date", same image comes up? Do the same thing. Might help.

Another issue is people using vague titles. The more direct the title is in relation to the content the less likelihood of reposts if people do use the hot/search functions.

And as a final note, yeah. Some people do seem to have the wrong idea about what is /WTF/ worthy and what isn't. I see a lot of stuff that should go in /midlyinteresting/ or /funny/ or /videos/ etc. The definition of WTF is subjective. I don't think anyone will ever be satisfied with this sub without accepting that. Instead of complaining, just keep weeding through things and commend those that satisfy your definition and then move on.  I agree with most everything posted so far and would like to add that 'joke' items or art that were intentionally designed to be WTF aren't really WFT material.

Of course, combine this with all of the other things that we say aren't WTF and you'll have a really dead sub. Because not much is WFT to people who've been on the internet for a while. I really have to say that, personally, I don't think gore is intrinstically WTF, nor is death. They can be remarkable or surprising or unfortunate or grisly, but none of that is 'what the fuck' value except for it being simply gruesome to the average viewer, more akin to the Horror movies that just go 'boo!' and startle you as opposed to installing a deep, beneath the surface horror.

That's what I think, personally, /r/wtf should have. You see it, you comprehend it, and yet, somehow.. something about it is off, it's disturbing, it's unsettling.. It makes your brow furrow and your mouth silently spell out the eponymous 'what the fuck.'  Just delete the posts that aren't Wtf. It's simple.  /r/WTF is something that makes you say, well, what the fuck. It's subjective, something that may shock you may not shock me. The veterans of this subreddit are much more used to seeing the things here, while newer subscribers may be a bit more squeamish.

Personally, I don't think you should do anything about it. The things that are truly WTF will get upvoted and what's tame, will rot. 

Besides, if you make this a 'Wow that's fascinating' sub a lot of the members will unsubscribe. The ones who are looking for that are already subscribed to /r/mildlyinteresting.

If you wish to remove stuff that's obviously not interesting/wtf like a mild blister, go ahead, but don't deem the whole sub gore only, or just.. "oh that's intresting", isn't there /r/nsfw_wtf  for that, anyway?

 I am surprisingly still subbed to this subreddit. The gore doesn't bother me, neither does the "tame" stuff. I would ask that there be more moderation though. Dude fucking a woman in the '70's both dressed up like birds? Tag it NSFW. Man gets his arm severed off by a lathe? NSFL with Gore tag. Maggots inside the nasal canal? NSFL with Gross tag. Vomit, blood puddles, feces, or other bodily fluid, tag it. I haven't really done much in the way of posting, so I'm unsure if it can be tagged by the poster or not, but I would like to see things tagged pretty consistently so the squemish can NOPE! out before even clicking.

Otherwise, I think almost every image I've clicked on I've said "wtf" to. It may not be a serious wtf, but may be a "wtf is this doing in this subreddit", but it's still a wtf. Leave it.as is  I think all the blood and guts should just stick to /r/Gore. It's not WTF. To some, it's just gross. wtf should be about wtf. if you cut your arm with a chainsaw, it's not wtf worthy the missing arm  What the fuck. If they provide the full story to what happened, It removes the "WTF"-ness of the post. When someone posted the picture of the body parts found in a shark, that was WTF because it's got no context. If it came with a full story in the title as to who the person was and how he ended up like that, I wouldn#t be so grossed out. More gore. Please? That's true wtf. Also very confusing pictures, like Cupid and venus' golden shower. Can the Mods put together a list of other subreddits in the rules where people can post their not so wtf things (I.e. /r/cringe for people of walmart)? New users probably don't know about them and default to /r/wtf.

Sorry if this is already a thing, mainly a mobile user so I don't see front pages often. A clown fucking a woman with no arms is WTF, a weird bug is not I'm getting sick of all those bullshit "look at the note someone left on my car" posts.  All the Porn posts annoy the shit out of me.  It's porn, not wtf. If I want to see porn I can, at anytime, anywhere, and I don't visit Reddit for porn. The more fucked up the better. Bring on the gore, bring the worst. Maybe create a varsity and jv wtf. I've rarely seen anything too fucked up here, but all the time I see tame shit. how about people just get their tampons out of the wrong hole. the little arrows on the left? THATS what they are there for. you dont like something, downvote it. or if you think it might be questionable, well then dont click on the link.  I find that usually these attempts don't work. Many subreddits that I subscribe to have done this and have been met with much resistance and little content.  

That being said, I think it would benefit humanity in general if there was a rule about being respectful to people in both the comments and the posts.  I see homophobic comments quite often and I see comments ridiculing a person's character based on a single photo.  I don't think assholery should be allowed.  Free speech is not being able to say whatever you want without consequences.  Free speech is specifically the right to speak against your government without being arrested.  I'm tired of folks who don't understand that distinction.  ..wasn't fascinated. It's pretty simple really, you can't please everyone so I would think if wtf crosses your mind when seeing something for the first time it should count! I think that injuries can be WTF worthy but not all gore is WTF worthy. I don't think it should be excluded. but I think it should be selective. i dont see things like motorcycle accidents worthy as WTF but maybe maggot surgery could be as long as it's marked NSFW I don't see the issue. "All (&amp; only) things that make you say WTF" is in bold, shouldn't that apply to ALL the content here? I say too much content that doesn't even spark me to say "what the fuck". Posts that aren't wtf get upvoted because it's interesting or "cool". If people complain about graphic things on this sub, they need to unsubscribe because the whole purpose of /r/wtf is to make you say/think "Holy shit, what the fuck". 

If it's fucked up, and I'm not talking about some picture of lame parking or something slightly creepy, it should belong here. Otherwise, remove it before new redditors think that's the norm for /r/wtf and fill the sub with THEIR lame content. There is a sub called r/daaang   For when something is more than mildly interesting, but WTF would be an overstatement. Reposts. Get rid of them. Completely.  So basically WTF does play a lot into the idea of people's subjective experiences of certain phenomena. For example, a fellow stoner would better understand another stoner's "wtf" at something a non-stoner would find mundane. Even if "fellow stoner" happens to be not-stoned at the time of viewing, he can still understand the other's POV. 

WTF needs to be a subtle mix of random/shocking/puzzling.  Things that make you literally think inside your dad "what the fuck".  Just like any ambigious system there will be problems. I just use the tools they give me. If there is a repost, I make the person aware of it. If there is something posted that isn't WTF (clearly), then I downvote it. That's why we have the upvote and the downvote.You have to take into account there are many immature people here who have never seen a paper cut, a turtle or a spider. Maybe we should just turn WTF into Where's the fan?, a subreddit in which you play an eye-spy type game, only you look for fans (the electronic type). That's a good idea, right? Right? Anything that looks extremely easy to replicate probably was fabricated. Like that guy yesterday who posted a photo of an insulin needle in a walmart parking lot, but it somehow just happened to have the cap next to it. IE anyone could have gone into their neighborhood, put a needle in the street and been like 'LOL DIS IS RONG'. 

Besides, all you have to do is just walk away or something.  WTF means what the fuck. If someone thinks things are too crazy on this subreddit, then they need to change subs WTF! There is nothing wrong with /r/wtf!  I think there needs to be some sort of mod lead standard on reposts. Every time something is reposted it becomes a circle jerk between the people that post karma decay and the people who are seeing it the first time. Now I have lurked here on wtf for several years and I feel like I see 50% not wtf worthy content and of the other 50% half is reposts. 

What about like a bestofwtf sub or even like a weekly sticky. This will allow us to acknowledge the true wtf worthy posts and promote new content. I know it won't eliminate it but if we are vigilant with our up and down votes we can get rid of the reposts. I saw a piece of a woman's vagina that had been bitten off during sex.
That's holy shit.

WTF is like the boulder almost hitting the car. I think both types o posts should be welcomed. There is a great mixture of fascinating, and wtf material. If both are welcomed, no one should be disappointed. I think everyone should stop thinking they know for fact what is "wtf" your definition is not my definition. People will always have
 a different opinion on what is "worthy of WTF" I say stop acting like babies and don't click posts about injuries and so forth. If you find a post YOU PERSONALLY don't like just downvote and move on, if its a bad post others will do the same and then,  guess what? Its buried and right where it should be. I'm not trying to come off rude I'm just tired of people crying because the posts here aren't what THEY want its not hardcore enough or its too hardcore. Its not going please everyone all the time.  There are different ways to say WTF, as there are different things that make us say WTF. If we are so concerned with what our opinion is of things that make us go WTF, then we need to get rid of the sub all together and break it up into the 5,000+ different things that have been posted.

It is probably one of the most broad subs in all of reddit, and probably the most popular of all the broad subs. I think ignoring the whining about what sub it belongs in (for the most part, because it is just an argument about what people consider WTF worthy) would be the smartest thing to do. Don't fix something that really isn't broke.

At least that is my opinion. I remember seeing a post that said if a post in /r/wtf doesn't literally make you say "What the fuck" when you're looking at the pic, video or whatever. And that rule has worked for me ever since.  Where is  WTF/Porn. I'm very annoyed with the increase of broken bones and other injuries posted on here. When you break a bone or cut yourself, it's GOING to look bad. It's not WTF. I've never seen a broken bone and said "WTF". Tbh "normal" gore like broken/lost fingers/toes, broken arms, etc. is not wtf, there has been way too much of this crap in here lately. I think it's fine as is.. I've found a good fun subreddit that keeps me on my toes. Don't change a thing!  If all the posts are removed that do not fit somebodies idea of "wtf" there would be about 10 posts a day. I am really sick of reading "this is not wtf". I think people now are competing with each other in order to be the first person to write "this is not wtf".  I think when used in context, WTF generally means something shocking or surprising. As a result, I think it can mean depictions of crazy violence or injury just as much as it can be a sign posted somewhere that left someone scratching their head. Stop posting double parking pictures or shit like you openes a box and your candle was broken inside. WTF is gore, serial killers, fucked up shit. Lol Stop posting double parking pictures or shit like you openes a box and your candle was broken inside. WTF is gore, serial killers, fucked up shit. Lol Everyone is going to say to remove everything. This person wants no spiders, this one wants no mildly wtf, this one wants no gore, the one over there says no genitals, what will be left? Everyone could avoid content they didn't want to see if all posts that fell neatly into one category had a [GORE] or [PENIS] or [SPIDER] sitting next to it.  More gore, less sfw pics please. I know we all have opinions but saying oh it's gore it's not wtf just doesn't fly.  I find gore to be super wtf. Also if it's sfw it prolly isn't truly wtf. This sub is too big to just say oh these 5 things are OK. What people think is wtf varies. I know my wtf isn't everyone else's.  More gore. Porn is okay too, but an emphasis on the gore.  IMO, if it does NOT make you make a face similar to the one in the top left corner, it does NOT belong here. Honestly I think gorey stuff is WTf worthy, does it not make you say wtf? Like wtf how and why did that happen. To be honest people complaining is WTF in itself. If you didn't want to see gore stuff shouldn't be on wtf and most of them have warnings stating gore or nsfw nsfl. Etc. Just my opinion and I'm sure it conflicts with eryone else. A lot of the post are gore from other countries and shit that goes on there is wtf. But to put limitations here for gore Idk feels like were being shorted. Like I'll go to gore if I purely wanna see that shit. Or stay in wtf cause its better and more the my liking I honestly like the variety that I find when I come to /r/WTF. I don't really have a problem with most of the stuff here, beyond things that are NSFW, and not labeled as such. The way I see it, there is always a point when something that is just weird, gross, unexpected, or just out of the ordinary, becomes WTF, and that point is different for everybody.

Also, I don't like how everyone keeps on getting bent out of shape over reposts. Sure, I'm pretty new to Reddit, but I've seen my fair share of stuff on the internet that I find again on Reddit, and I'm not flipping tables over it, I just keep scrolling. I just don't like it when people try to claim responsibility for something that isn't theirs.

You don't need to change /r/WTF, I love you just the way you are. Walmart got to a point where even r/wtf doesn't want it I feel like /r/wtf should be about nearly everything that causes that feeling.  Porn?  If it's crazy weird, go for it.  Weird gore?  Still falls into the category.  Creepy mechanical clown?  It's all weird stuff.  That's what this subreddit is here for.  It's meant to show us the extremes of the world, and I don't think any limiting or subjective posts can improve on that. Broken bones are not necessarily WTF, yet many posts like this exist. I think anything that makes you (the poster) say "WTF!?" is worthy of r/wtf. 

This is a rather subjective guideline. However, I don't think you can really sit here and say that it has to be something like "disturbingly, surprisingly uncomprehendible" as a hard requirement, because that's not really any less subjective.

People can't bitch about too much gore as long as the posts with such content are labeled appropriately so (all the ones I've seen have been.) The same goes with porn tags, or death tags or any of the other tags seen here. People are on r/wtf and they cannot bitch about those things they see if they are given a warning/description of what they are voluntarily choosing to see.

I like the variety of things on r/wtf, and I have been amused by enough of the 'walmart' type posts that I cannot agree they shouldn't show up here. Ultimately, this kind of boils down to being a shock value subreddit, and that's pretty much what it seems it should be. Why else would your reaction be "what the fuck?" WTF should be: "What The Fuck did I just see?" NOT: "What The Fuck?! Can you believe this?" Also, gore is bullshit.  No animal cruelty/beastiality should be allowed. I prefer /r/wtf to be about bizarre things, not dead things, gore, misplaced nudity, or things that make you jump. It seems to me, after reading many of this posts, that things are as unclear as when the moderator posed the question.  That being said many things in this sub I would not consider WTF but thoroughly enjoy the overall feel.   Can something called "wtf" really be about something? Its like a room of mirrors, and nothing is solid between perspectives. I want a Bert, from Bert &amp; Ernie, angry face watermarked on the /r/wtf subreddit to remind us of... ya :D Al Gore WTF posts should literally make you say 'what the fuck.' Gore, weird and creepy shit. Spiders? Only if they look fucking weird, or there's hundreds of them My biggest thing is that injuries does not constitute what the fuck. It just makes me go, "Ow," or "Yech". It isn't strange or bizarre. They happen all the time. Now, a forest full of doll heads nailed to the trees. That's WTF worthy.  WTF: Why The Face &gt;All (&amp; only) things that make you say WTF.

pretty much nails it... Less gore, only things that makes you say "WTF".  My opinion, is if you did not say or think "What the Fuck" or "Dafuck" or just generally weren't in that state of mind when you view a picture, it's not WTF. WTF= Where's The Face?  sorta like a where's waldo game If I look at a post and I say "What the fuck?" then it is proper content. I love WTF.  The only thing that I hate is when someone posts something you see every day, or someone reposts. I have become a lot more aware of the world around me because of WTF. Too much gore, there should be, or is, a sub reddit for gore  Honestly, period bloodstains are not WTF. We've all seen it before, it happens, it's maybe a little gross to see sometimes, but it's too normal and common to be WTF, especially considering the amount of misogyny that it stirs up. Just like the Wal-Mart pics, either these people are having a really awful day, or they aren't entirely there mentally. Leave them alone. Let's not encourage creep shots of any kind. This is not r/gore  WTF is well... WTF.

Gore makes you say WTF and so does weird and crazy stuff.
It doesn't have to be gore to be WTF but that's not to say it it can't be.

IMO WTF should be filled with ANYTHING that has made a person say WTF, if the community agrees it is upvoted isn't it? If not, downvote to hell!

Just my opinion :) I just like seeing WTF content, this subreddit is really cool. Just weird fucking shit Isn't what the fuck since there's a question mark? If I see one more hole in a body part that should be expected based upon what the person did I don't want to see it. Really. And if people post shit like that they should have to put in the title [injury] because I really can't stomach that stuff some days. I'm not on /r/gore for a reason. WTF is everything and anything that takes someone out of their usual comfort zone. its very subjective. WTF should be anything that leaves you speechless and and keeps you up at night. I am really tired of poops IN toilets, and waiters/waitresses not getting tips cause Obamer I know everyone's threshold is different, but if the pic makes you go hmm, huh, or weird, get rid of it. If it makes you legitimately say what the fuck!? it's a keeper.  just remove reposts, I get tired of seeing posts pop up after a few months/weeks/days.

 This kind of mod post and attention to this subreddit is long overdue! I for one am looking forward to the refined changes!  Wtf is a difficult section..everyone has their opinion on WTF means so if people feel there is to much gore or nudity then go else where.I see this place as an awsome bin of random wtf pics and stories leave it be  WTF should always allow whatever makes you look at your monitor and say "wha?"

that's a huge swath of content. frankly, i believe nothing should be off limits. /r/WTF should mirror what /b/ on 4chan allows - anything and everything - as long as it makes you say "wha?"

just my 2 cents... One thing we should consider is that everyone is civil and sane. Jokes are good sometimes, but I think when we see an intriguing post that disturbs or fascinates us, explanations and breakdowns should take precedence over jokes and puns. I seriously hate going into a thread showing a horrific injuries and being flooded with jokes and puns, I don't know the exact implementation, but I think /r/wtf would be a great place to put sense and sanity into the world if we preferred closure over humor. Less gore and death. There's already subreddits for both of those things. More strange and unusual as opposed to someone's blown off leg or someone getting smacked by a truck. To clarify, there is a difference between someone with a gnarly "WTF" infection and someone who just got decapitated for making the wrong call at a soccer match.   Stop with the indignation porn, which is just a way around Rule #3.

"OMG I found a lawn jockey in Grannie's attic!"

5000 commenters: "I'm a superior being and would so hate on that." don't let these butthurt critics tell you guys how to moderate this wonderfully cultivated cesspool of fright, terror, and things that make me wanna vomit. If you allow people to try to regulate this subreddit it will make a lot of us lose faith in humanity, so please don't let anyone change anything about this subreddit. It's the place I go whenever the world shoves a boot up my ass and I need a place to find things that say "
HAH!! Society thinks they can control everything.". Hideous deformations as the result of a rare disease might well be WTF.

People with bodies that aren't the norm of attractiveness in Western culture (fat, skinny, gender-variant or ambiguous, unstylish, etc.) are *not* wtf, whether taken at Wallmart or elsewhere. Linking to photos of them (especially photos obviously taken without their permission) is just plain rude.

Yes, that shit makes me say WTF — It makes me say "Why the fuck did the poster think that was cool? Fuck that asshole." I feel that /r/wtf turned into, "look at this weird thing" "look at this dude sticking things in his dick" I thought it is for thing that make you say WTF, not OMG WHY DID I CLICK ON THAT, or MY EYES!

My problem is some of the real disturbing NSFW material, you can say, "then dont click on it" well that is BS, most have misleading titles, and some are barely NSFW 

there should be a /r/fuckingnasty or /r/sickfucks for those nasty dick pictures/gifs. 

I come to WTF for weird shit not burn fucked up images into my brain shit. Or at least tag NotSafeForLife or whatever
 Wtf that's not wtf... I know exactly what fucks those fuck.
 Amputations, blood, guts, ER pics AKA gore should be posted on r/gore not wtf 

It is the single most frustrating thing to continually see chopped off and cut up body parts. It's not wtf, you got injured so unless a rabid giraffe came up and took a bite out of your ass and was able to blow a bubble with it like some hubba bubble magician and you have pics proving it, it is not wtf.  Go to the subreddit DESIGNATED for gore
End rant Kind of like /r/woahdude but with a dark twist to it How about content that makes you think "WTF"?
 Pretty simple.  It makes you say (or think) "WTF" I've just been voted all to hell for title Wtf did i just read, post...It's clearly all about incest...and there is an incest reddit already.

Just fyi.

Not happy. NO PORN

NO GORE

NO SLENDERMAN

NO SCP
 Who clicks/posts/tags on a "WTF" (What the fuck) thread without something that is WTF? I'm sorry, but GTFO. :) Titles need to get the point and not have pointless backstory like "so I was riding down the street listening to the radio and THIS is what we stop behind." I like odd and surreal. fish with four eyes, hobos dressed in a with a boba fett mask, really WHAT THE FUCK?! sort of things.

Simply being gore is a bit banal, bit something fiery and odd, perfectly fine.

I like the sideshow element I think that as far as gore is concerned, WTF is really more important as to HOW or WHY the gore is WTF. I think bugs, gore, ""creepy things"" and dumb injuries (shit like missing fingernails), and porn should be out. Porn isn't wtf, unless it's a weirdass fetish like sticking toothpicks into your urethra. Can we see a decrease in people who have soiled themselves/pooped in public/shit in an odd place? Its an unfortunate or drunken accident, not really wtf. Also, cars covered in religious or politically outrageous propaganda, or dolls or whatever. Not at all wtf.

Also "when you see it..." is played out and usually something not really wtf like a man with an erection in the background. Wtf should not have an agenda. ie; discrimination, racism, religion etc; I like almost all of it, assuming it is tagged properly. 

My pet peeve about the forum is the downvotes that result when trying to convey to a poster that they *need to tag* certain content. 

WTF can really vary. It shouldn't just be one thing for one time. If my kid is in the room I don't mind clicking on weird haircuts or other "tame" content. I save the tagged content for bedtime reading on my kindle. I have my PC account set to not show tagged entries. 

So I guess I'm saying that personally, I like gore (especially medical stuff), I like the milder content, I like things that make me say "WTF, cool!" I don't really care for the porn but assuming it's tagged I simply don't click on it. I don't need to define what others find WTF worthy.
 Anything that's interesting or disturbing in general really, but i dont want to see stuff that you KNOW belongs in another subreddit, like Rage inducers or stupid material or facepalm things. Seriously. 


 When I scroll through the pictures and links on here, I say to myself or out loud, "Why is this posted on WTF?" or "How is that WTF?" more than actually thinking, "What the fuck...?" A lot needs to be taken out, people of walmart is overdone, the massive re-posts should be taken down and of course the gore posts. When I see someone who lost a finger or limb, I usually don't find that too weird, I just find it a little queasy.  Cut out some things that are routine here like thumbs and fingers that are sliced or cut, missing fingernails, gashes, etc. We've all been injured or seen injuries. No injuries unless it something really weird or rare like a shark bite or something stuck in a human that shouldn't be, etc. Regular injuries are not wtf.

Also spiders, bugs, etc. They're just getting old. Unless the are doing something cool no more bugs. This sub should be about fucked up shit. Not optical illusions and weird bumper stickers. Also there pictures of big bugs shouldn't be allowed, for they are bugs and we have all seen bugs before. normal porn is boring, porn brought to WTF is interesting...
Gore is interesting and very WTF...in my opinion...
I DONT think they are the only things that qualify as WTF...I find lots of interesting things on here....but yes, Parking spots are stupid
 its wtf, anything that when u sees it makes u think WTF should be in, weather thats, wtf thats weird, or wtf thats fucked up, any wtf moments are fair game It's got to be something that you don't expect or have not seen before. For example, a table saw would obviously slice your hand open, but if someone was using it for some sort of fetish and got their feet stuck in it, then that would be WTF. Hopefully my point is clear.

None of this sissy "look what came out of my nose/cist/urethra/whatever". The question "why" should have NO REASONABLE ANSWER. I think wtf should be things that TRULY make you shout what the fuck. Not some stupid picture of a newspaper, or anything similar I like the content but I wish people were more committed to including "gore", "x-phobia", "porn" warning labels so I know what I'm getting into.  Nature is not WTF to me. I do not care that a frog eats animals. I eat animals. I do not care that you have a picture of a fat bitch. Not really wtf to me I see fat and dumb people every day. I want to see stuff that does not make me laugh. I want stuff that makes me question what the fuck. Posts I saw today which I consider WTF: the orangutan prostitute, the incest family. (Only two that really stand out)  I would also like it if more people used the warnings a little better. Specifically Spiders and Bugs. The idea of WTF is pretty subjective---for the most part, I'm okay with how its done Simply unless when you saw whatever you took the picture of and said WTF or got an injury that was WTF like your penis impaled a midget when you slung shot her into it...it's not WTF worthy. Oh you also used a mandolin slicer and hurt yourself? wow! cool story bro, take it to /r/gore that's not WTF. I get that everyone has a different opinion of what "wtf" means to them, but need to seriously understand what the vast majority of us deem is WTF. wtf | wət ðə fək |
pronoun
an exclamation meant to descriptively ascribe to the thing being seen as creating a sense of disbelief in the viewer at its veracity or simply towards the fact that the thing being viewed can indeed exist in the viewer's world. r/WTF is here to make you say WHAT THE FUCK out loud by yourself. i don't care what it is i just want to be able to say What the fuck not WOW that's fascinating ! It should be about strange, unexpected things, plain and simple. "I had a car accident and broke my arm" is not strange and unexpected. "My car accident was caused by an elephant crossing the road in Wyoming" is unexpected. Things that are just plain weird also fit.

I'm starting to think drastic action needs to be taken against those posting "LOL THAT GUY POOPED HIS PANTS", especially those who post obvious photoshops. You tell these people that their content is not WTF and not only do they reply with a bullshit statement like "Well I saw someone else post it", but you in turn get downvoted into oblivion by people who obviously want /r/wtf to turn into /r/pics2.0 I personally am very happy with it. I feel like the point of this subreddit is to make me say "WTF" and I do. I like the gore, the weird pictures, just basically anything.  It doesn't hurt my feelings in the least if someone posts something that I think doesn't belong here. It usually doesn't happen to me. But when it does I just think ? To myself as I click back out. 

I like the way this sub is going. 

I also like gore.  keep it like this.
some of the gore post have NSFW tags too right? Yup WTF is my first 'go to' site when I get home from work! I like 'all' the posts...gore, nsfw, gross, and simply 'WTF?'....don't change! You're perfect. WTF in my eyes could be something that is unexpected things/events or disturbingly weird. Injuries would only go under WTF if has some strage result that isnt the normality for what happend. Strange, unbelievable things. I think wtf is fine as I've known it. If I don't find it wtf, I know someone else does.  We can't all be as twisted as I am. Eh, people are always going to bitch.  What's WTF to me is probably a lot different than to others and so on.  

Were it "Only things that literally make Hooj audibly say WTF" then this subreddit would have tumble weeds blowing past it.  However, I don't mind clicking through and looking at stuff that is "mildly" wtf to me.   Expected outcome does not equal WTF. You broke your arm and it's bleeding? NO WAY. Your friend got in a car accident and the car is totaled? NO WAY.... The unnerving version of /r/mildlyinteresting.
Things that are either just gory or R-rated for some reason can find another subreddit. The toad-eating-a-bird post from today is a good example of what I'm a fan of. It's more WTF than mildly interesting, but still eyebrow-raising and kind of cool. Just weird or gore doesn't qualify.  My best suggestion would be to take /r/wtf off of the default sub list. I am one of the many that have messaged the mods complaining about the decline of the content(i.e. the pheasant that was on the front page or "muscular" animals). I thoroughly enjoy this sub when the content is fitting but as of late it has caused me more stress than I care to admit to due to material being fairly normal and not at all wtf worthy. What the fuck? Why the fuck? Who the fuck? Where the fuck? When the fuck?

At some point or another, I have said a variant of "WTF" while browsing /r/WTF and when I see something that makes me go, "Hm. Neat!" instead of "What the fuck?" I am immediately disappointed and discouraged. This Sub should be for things that legitimately make you question what is happening, not for "fascinating" things that can be posted in any number of other threads. Let us WTFers have our WTF and let the boring folk browse a place full of nice, gentle, mind-enhancing articles/photos. Everything is fine as is, but make tagging gore and death mandatory.  Toads eating animals that fit in their mouth is not wtf worthy, it's what they do.  I find a lot of posts intended to be funny in /r/WTF. Just something to look out for. As a lot of people here are saying, what qualifies as truly wtf-worthy is highly subjective.

Therefore, in addition to this discussion, I think people should describe the top one or two wtf posts that they feel are quintessentially wtf, and people can Upvote and downvote accordingly to show the mods how representative the examples are. 

I'll start: the most wtf post I ever saw was a gif of anal sex where the guy pulled out and a long tube of shit came out and the guy went right back in. Just to show the range though, another post was some wigger looking dude in a bath tub full of newports.  I don't mind either. but I lean more towards the WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK side. We all know Walmart has some strange ass shoppers, but I'm thinking we should really ease the throttle on that one. I am OK with it all disturbingly weird or shocking but not appalling.  Oh god finally a chance to give feedback. A lot of posts recently have been way too lame (like a fucking sneaker on top of a car, or a spilled drink in a grocery store). Lame ass crap like that isn't wtf. Seeing something out of the ordinary on a gross or amazing level constitutes wtf material for me (for example: a man getting his arm cut off in a machine or a police raid officer kicking in a windshield and rolling off the hood, or finding a black widow in your coffee cup)  It would be nice and if the NSFW tags had reasons why they were tagged next to them, like: gore, blood, nudity, sex, etc. Or, the NSFW tags could be rated on a scale from 1-10.  Its been said before, but truly the one rule should be that the reaction to the post must have made the poster say 'wtf?!'. That being said I do not mind gore or disturbing images as long as they are legitimately unexplainable(wtf!)
 Content taken from /r/GIFS and /r/FUNNY shouldn't be reposted here.  I am rarely impressed by gore.  A guy cut the tip of his finger off with a circular saw? Yup, sure is bleeding and a little gross. Not WTF.  However I am not opposed to gore, it just has to be beyond the ordinary.  A guy gets run over by a tank and pops like a toothpaste tube?  That is WTF.
The guiding light on this subreddit should be whether or not an image, link, or vid would make you verbalize aloud the subbreddits name. I love WTF, but why have posts of someone pulling maggots out of a hairy nose? This isn't fair to my inner child.  i remember when there're were all these post about getting back to /r/WTF roots i remember it fondly.  As long as its gorey, scary, sketched, unordinary, some trippy shroom shit, or just unexplainable wtf. Idc, entertain me.  I don't like seeing pictures of animals that have been mistreated. It doesn't surprise or delight me, it saddens me. Is not wtf To be honest, the concept of "WTF(-ing)" people have a variety of thresholds. In my opinion I think it needs to be over top, and disgusting. Because this the nature of the topic. For example, watching a horror film and saying it is too scar defeats the purpose of the film, doesn't it? If you can't handle I advice you stay away from NSFW or NSFL post.

My opinion. Thanks for reading. Its really age and experience that defines wtf. 20 year olds might think that the cigarette tv commercials are wtf, whereas a 50 yo would not. The art projects shown are also not really wtf, unless they are made of real body parts, not just some PhotoShop magic.  I'm cool with this subreddit the way it is. 
EXCEPT!!!! for those idiots who keep posting pics of their broken toenail or a cut from a knife/saw/scissors/... in their finger/arm/leg/head.
Seriously FUCK OFF. Spam it on your twitter or facebook or whatever. read rule #3 I say if people want to be pansies there is the /r/awww section. I want gore and violence. a nail through a hand is kindergarten, show me dismemberment and shit I just have one issue... Why did this suddenly become [/r/popping](http://reddit.com/r/popping)? Over the past few days, I have seen at least 30 different things about draining an abscess of anything, usually a cow. Don't combine subreddits... I know my comment will get lost in this sea of bullshit, but I'll try anyway. Keep the sub how it is. I don't want to go off one person's idea of WTF. Several of the top comments here are B- worthy at best. WTF is just fine. Unexpected stuff, injuries, walmart fuckeries, the whole lot of it. If ANYONE clicks something and the first reaction is "WTF?" then we are good. Don't ruin this sub assholes. I'll be real pissed if another sub I subscribe to is killed by a few loud members of the community. Just make r/ohmygoodness for the genius' that think double parking is wtf. How about color coding?

-NSFW Extreme gore/nightmare inducing/ball churning stuff to be highlighted in red.

-NSFW nudity/sex/disturbing/shocking/wtf but to a lesser degree - yellow

-better than mildlyinteresting, but not yawn inducing-green

ofcourse, everyone wouldnt judge the different levels the same way and would take a little getting used to. It would also be great if we could filter by colour, so that depending on what I want to see, Ill see just the mild or just the extreme.
 The post should make you ask "how?" Or "why?" Doesn't need to be gross or stupid, but if you think WTF, then it's probably r/wrf post worthy.  Rather than saying what I don't want in wtf, I will try to define what I expect from something WTF-worthy. 



1. Looking at the picture should make it immediately obvious what is wtf about it. Exception: if there's some small detail that makes the post wtf-worthy that's acceptable.  


2. It should be something that's extremely out of the ordinary AND attention grabbing. Attention grabbing is key. 

3. There should be an element of the unexpected. If the situation is a reasonable  result of some prior action, that's not wtf worthy. 

examples: a car doing a 360 next to a school bus is wtf worthy. Bubbles on your dashboard, while out of the ordinary for most people, is not wtf-worthy. 

 WTF should be about thing that "WTFucker" want to see. Don't delete anything, upvote and downvote are there for that I don't get people? why can't you just skip the stuff you don't like instead of complaining you wasted 2 seconds of your life opening and closing a picture? How about just leaving the page alone!? I like it just how it is. If you don't....Then Bye!!! Although toleration of everybody's wants and desires is great, /r/WTF was titled that for a purpose. In fact every sub has a purpose. If we let anyone post anything, this sub will lose the purpose that brought us all here in the first place.

We come to this sub specifically for the purpose of saying "What the fuck?" If we wanted to say "Wow that's fascinating," we wouldn't come here, we'd go to /r/interesting or /r/mildlyinteresting or /r/fascinating or any sub that has that as its purpose. If we wanted random assortment: /r/anythinggoes, /r/anythinggoesnsfw, or /r/anythingoespics. If we want gore: /r/gore. 

The point is what's the purpose of subscribing to this sub if it's not fulfilling a niche on reddit? If I can get my fix of all this elsewhere, why come here?

Some might say "but the specific combination of flavors is not fulfilled by other subs." If you want combinations of different content, then open the subs that were made to specialize in that content together. For example, if I want to be fascinated and see gore:

http://www.reddit.com/r/fascinating+gore

We've already seen what happens when mods go lax on submissions just to get the maximum potential of subscribers and, for example, /r/funny might as well be a mix of /r/mildlyinteresting, /r/memesirl, and a thousand other tidbits from various subs. And honestly, I see no point in it existing if I can see all that content on other subs that actually deliver what they promise.

There's no function /r/WTF serves that cannot be fulfilled by other means except hosting content that is "WHAT THE FUCK?!" worthy. So please, keep /r/WTF "WHAT THE FUCK?!" worthy, so that I know what to expect when I come here. If I wanted something unexpected, well... /r/unexpected. I am okay with all the gore, but the story behind it must be WTF. That or the injury must be WTF. For instance that gif of the guy with a chunk out of his hand and all the tendons still move, or pics/xrays of people alive with a pole through their skull or torso is WTF. But the standard that I go by is unless I think out loud "What the fuck?" it's not truly WTF. Most of the stuff I see on /r/WTF should be put in /r/pictures or /r/funny. That being said I usually only see 2 post out of the entire front page that actually make me go WTF. Most of the time the actually WTF pics or links only have 200-300 upvotes but something that is just funny and not wtf worthy will have 3k. WTF is a great subreddit as it is. To all those who say there is too much gore, what did you expect to find? Definitely a part of the whole WTF genre. To all those who complain about posts that are not shocking or odd enough keep in mind WTF is subjective. Simply move on to another post that is more to your liking. They can't all be winners. People need to stop complaining. It is what it is.  I think the more I "wtf" the less "wtf" shit seems.  If I do or could have said "wtf", then it deserves to be here.  Unfortunately "wtf" seems to be gauged by age and the amount of twisted dick japanese porn people watch.  Naturally,  a 12 yr olds butterfly on poop "wtf" is tame compared to a 40 yr old  with a war room style computer set up, neck beard and seven cats and a cum box's idea of "WTF".  The only logical answer is to explain that "WTF" means " WHAT THE FUCK" not "WHAT THE FROG is eating" unless it's eating a baby human.  Not "WHAT THE FUN a broken rope swing" unless it broke off a cliff and the swinger plinkoed down the face of a mountain for 10 minutes.  My opinion. Let's just ban all the spider posts and work our way from there. Whenever I browse this subreddit, I can only stop once I actually say aloud "What the fuck."   I don't know why but I force myself to keep looking until I say those words. Lately WTF has been making me say "eww" or "holy shit that would hurt" because a large portion of these posts are simply injuries.  
Some guy gets his foot twisted backwards in football so he posts it here and gets a karma flood... Thats not what this should be about.. not just stupid injuries like "oh I stubbed my toe and now its swollen to the size of a tennis ball!" Sure that might induce a "what the fuck" from me but it's not entertaining... At least not *as* entertaining as the true WTF: a horrifying ritual someones neighbor preformed and was recorded, or a disgusting fetish involving bugs. ...These are the things that really make me want to shut off my laptop for the night. Not the stupid injury posts which flood this subreddit now. I feel like a lot of the comments here ask for things to be posted in other subreddits, however, I think you all forget that we're one of the major subreddits--posting other subreddits won't get you all the karma or comments or exposure you're going to find here. just a thought. 


However, I agree there are a lot of things that need to be taken to /r/mildlyinteresting and /r/cringepics.


Basically, just narrow it down to: Does it make you say WTF? Do you think it will make other people say WTF? Does it fit better in another subreddit? If so, try your luck in the alternate sub instead of WTF. 


What would be helpful would be a list of alternate subreddits so that we don't have a bunch of posts "not sure if wtf but..." You look at it and say what the fuck..  To much Gore! WTF = what is the world coming to? Honestly I love coming to this subreddit cause I find things that are hilarious but also force a WTF out of me that r/funny just doesn't do. I personally don't like the gore too much so I just don't click on it. It's only like 1-2 links per page at best so I do t think it matters that much.  WTF can be said with many vocal connotations. WTF! WTF? WT..f wtf??
That's what WTF is. A homogenous mix of WTFs. If it says "gore", and you're not into gore, don't fuckin' click it! Simple.   I think r/WTF is fine as it is. Some things I agree are not worthy, and some things I believe would do better on another subreddit. But this sub has been my #1 favorite ever since I began redditing. There's a good variety on this page and I think the pieces that aren't worthwhile make the best ones all the better. It's like a surprise each time. You may strike out on ten in a row, but then you find one post that just makes your entire evening, and that makes r/WTF worth every second of my time.  What annoys me is the obvious, (i.e. steroids at the gym, bad parking, generally normal broken bones). If common sense is anywhere in the "equation" then it's not WTF material. Hoooly shit. Deer down! Gore should be on /r/gore I want to lean back in my chair and go "WHAT THE FUCK?!" not eww... Anything that would cause an average adult to say /r/wtf.  Japanese animation, gamer experiences, cell phone problems, creepy dolls and clowns, smiling animals, spiders, a little blister on your big toe, warts, clogged toilets, poop, flat tires, most artwork, people from Wal-Mart, something that would make a pre-pubescent or immature teen say /r/wtf,....just to name a few are NOT /r/wtf. I miss the violence that's why I created a reddit account in the first place for the way WTF used to be Don't change it.  wtf is wtf whether it is wtf worthy or wtf is this doing on wtf.  This isn't brain surgery. But, wtf, that's my opinion.  



 I want this board to be every bit the posts from r/morbidreality but with the jokes and humor of r/spacedicks. I wanna be able to crack a joke at something gross without getting any morality squad back-sass. As long as people are up/down voting, the community here will speak for itself.  things that when I open I got WTF. Not porn, not a mangled car (that can have exceptions and not anything else that is just gore. Something strange! Yall.are going.to.screw up.the one thing i like about the internet  /r/im14andthisiswtf Where is this? (If you don't mind my asking?) is it always this crowded?  Guy in the back right is staring into my soul.  MBTA, never (always?) a disappointment.  Looks like he gave up on his other hat.
         "I have A.D.H.D."
  "A delicious herpetic dick." I hate the green line.  Good old B line Open new tab. Search for new hat... Is his neck stuck like that from taste testing? red wings! Well was it delicious? A novelty hat? W.T.F!! GO WINGS!  Boston T baby Gotta love the green line I guess ADHD stands for A Delicious Huge Dick? Fuckin' Boston, man. Love my home.  Only in Boston...... Why are people still standing so close to him? Go Wings! Yet another reason why I hate public transport. Creeps can secretly take a photo of you. Fuck off OP. I knew this was from the Green Line in Boston immediately.


Source: I'm a regular rider on the Green line RED WINGS At first I was thinking Detroit based on the Red Wings t-shirt... Then I remembered we don't have public transport, just cars and shitty freeways (from Detroit and proud) I wonder how he would know Something about this photo is off.

It looks completely normal, but staring at it a while makes me uneasy.

 "And you know this how, exactly?" That's total green right there. Well , obviously it's so delicious he can't stop staring Detroit people mover?  EDIT: Nvm, Boston I see. A TASTELESS HAT?? WTF??  You stay classy, green line. *I don't believe you.* Gotta love the MBTA. Ah the good ol MBTA That crowd. I now remember why I spend money on parking instead of taking the bus. That picture makes me feel uneasy. As someone who rides the B-Green Line daily, I love people like this. They're the spice of life which makes the whiny BU students/Allston hipsters/Brookline yuppies manageable. This reminds me of something I would see on Squidbillies. Early Cuyler, baby! "Oh good, my dog needs a new chew toy" Ahem...as an official penis taste inspector, I shall be the judge of that. biggie smalls?  Damn, and I thought I was all that with my PHD.  Blame it on my ADD Something about this photo is off.

It looks completely normal, but staring at it a while makes me uneasy.

 And he can vouch for that claim himself. Well did he? Please deliver OP At least it seems to be sleeping. o yea I got that too. Interpretive dance troupe hahah nice  I'm pretty sure that's false advertising. i think i know that guy lol I saw that and walked away thinking the orange line shouldn't be as bad... Was slightly wrong.. its wasn't as bad but still bad. Its still an experience for this CA girl. Pfft. I'll be the judge of that. That white guy farthest back in the picture must be a GIANT fucking people, everywhere. too bad he doesnt have ADHD
A delisiously huge dick
fuck my dislexi
FUCK!!!!
 Idk guys I think that's a pretty funny hat. Man- that is a full bus Technically its been clinically referred to as a **A** **D**elicious **H**uge **D**ick since 1997. Is... is he wearing a dress over his t-shirt? I'm assuming this is a bus with steps down the aisle, either that or everybody got in and lined up according to height. How does he know? &gt;Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
&gt;I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
 The shading under the hat is like an anime samurai cartoon.
Master Swordsman of the Delicious Dick. Bitches love delicious dicks If I wanted to purchase this as a joke to a friend, where would I be able to find such a piece of art hat? Well, at least he's good enough to let us know.  I have ADHD, but I don't know what the h stands for. So, did he confirm this through a self administered taste test?  **LGRW!** uhhhh got enough people on that bus/train holy fuck I have ADHD... Took me a bit to see the face. I have A.D.H.D

A Delicious Huge Dick

/r/bigdickproblems I have ADHD, so can't say I'm to appreciative of that. Well, more specifically, ADD, but they have been recently smooched together. ...because of the snacks available? Green line represent! How would he know its delicious...:o? So you can reach to taste it? If that's the most offensive thing you ever see on the subway you're doing pretty well. This is just a Monday on the J train in my neck of the woods. Creep of the week my pussy tastes like pepsi cola  LGRW! green line, represent I could never live in a big city. Clausterphobia run a muk!!! I for one am glad that awkward question doesn't need to be asked.  Swear the title said 'pubic hair'. I need sleep. I clicked it regardless. So modest. [Relevant NSP Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHIKf0f9E40) wot. I expect to see this on Squidbillies next week. Nice to know A.D.D. is prevalent in Boston. Suck on my sal-ty chocolate balls {put 'em in yo' mouf!}, (put 'em in yo' mouf.) Am I the only one that thought there was going to be an old homeless guy jerking off? I'm going to assume he has also tasted said penis. He must've tasted it before. Perhaps he rubs it on his food?

That's what I think he does. Makes me think of squidbillies

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKhScy7E_aI I, too, love when everyone lines up in order of height without being asked.

I'm assuming you didn't ask, because public transport. REST IN PEACE BIG DADDY WTF? More like Where The Fuck can I buy this hat? What does this have to do with public transport other than being on it? Is that you Keanu Reeves? Do you love it because you took part in it? Did you manhandle that A.D.D.? I used to take the bus a lot because it is free to ride. It takes forever but free is fucking awesome!

Then I noticed this smelly woman who smelled like thousand year old socks covered in mold and then pissed on by a vinegar monster. She rode the bus every day. I couldn't fucking stand her smell. I could smell her in my nose hours later.

Smelly old bitch single handedly ruined public transportation for me.

Also. For $200 a month I am super happy that I don't have to ride on a bus with smelly people or be crammed in like a sardine like in that picture. What would take an hour on the bus takes 5 minutes in a car. Leaving me with lots of free time. Sooo... suck it environment! But I only drive about 25 miles a week on average so I am not destroying the world that much. Go Wings this is  hilarious, what u doin in r/wtf fool What's the point in acronyms if you always have to explain them.  Some people have a way with words dont knock it till you try it. That guy in the back is ridiculously tall. I thought it said "I have A D-D-Delicious Dick"

Then I properly read it and was disappointed. I ENJOY MY MISTAKE Was this on the green line to government center today? There was no room to stand at all. Pissed me off. Having lived in Boston, and ridden on the Green Line... this reminds me of my one-time home. Good times.  Kanye West once had a clever line in a song "I have a P.H.D. A pretty huge dick". Made me laugh. Honest question, but what would happen if somebody had just ripped one loudly.  How does he know? holy zoom ...Biggie Smalls? The T sucks...  Get it, Green Line.  It's even better because I was on this train in Boston! how would he know? I'd wear that hat. Please god tell me where I can buy this  Everything about that crowded, moshpit of bacteria is everything I dislike about public transport. GREEN LINE! That guy on the right is fucking tall yeah, that sure looks like it's DC Beantown represent! green line struggles. Leave this poor guy alone. Government cheese is tasty.  Green Line Boston. I'm getting uncomfortable just thinking about it. wait, you said you love public transport because there is a black man saying he has a delicious dick????????? The heck.. I love how I KNEW this was Boston based on the college drunk crowd first then because it was the green-line I have an S.T.D. -  Super Tasty Dick. Directions unclear, dick stick in handrail. OH GOD OP, HOW'D YOU DEAL WITH THAT HAT? Today OP was actually a faggot. Just remember this...that guy looked at all of his hats and thought "today seems like a delicious dick day" Chelsea likes tasty dicks.  My initials are ADD... Boston:  Because fahck y'ou! Where The Fuck can I buy that hat? Aaahhh the green line. Still can't hold a candle to my Orange line! i NEED this hat Almost as funny as on friends when phoebe had a date with the dude who had a PHD: Pretty Huge Dick. That whole date scene kills me every time. Bawston. That guy in the back = ulti tall That's a Seabass hat for sure. I wonder if he also has a PhD That guy is like school in the summertime - no class. I'm also a Red Wings fan! Heh today I saw a shirt that said "If you really loved me you would suck it" What a class act. So let me get this straight.... You love transit because of people with delicious dicks? Definitely thought the "I have A.D.D." and "A delicious dick" were meant to be two different thoughts.  awww yiss, MBTA coming up clutch. #yoloswag420 The Green Line is as much of WTF in-and-of-itself. Ah the green line. The MBTA. Gotta love it. Saw an Asian girl who did not speak any english wearing a hat that said "Come Fuck With Me"...in front of her mom. Yet another reason I ride a bicycle instead. well OP? DOES HE?  Is that the Notorious B.I.G.? Guy at top right: SOON... GO WINGS! Where do you buy this hat? Asking for a friend. My only question is what was he doing to find out how good it tasted, and how did he get so flexible? All I hear is his stutter... Biggie Smalls god i miss boston! This made drunk me laugh and then forget what the picture was and then laugh again how is this considered WTF is fucking hilarious Downvoting you because this is hilarious not r/wtf. guy looks like he's pretty notorious  biggie?????? T.N.B this is not wtf but good thing he doesn't have adhd I've seen posts on /r/mildlyinteresting with much higher entertainment value. What's next? Random guy wearing differently coloured shoelaces? As a woman I find this classy as fuck. Negros with their ''muh dik''. The only way they have to try to give value and relevance to their worthless and meaningless life.  /r/cringepics Not really WTF material. It's just a cap. I hope he has a daughter, and I hope she sees him wearing this hat.

OP is a bag of sticks. If it makes you say "lol, wtf?" it probably doesn't belong here. Nigga please MUH DIK I didn't even see the guy I thought someone hung that hat on the pole Ricky Shucks ? Looks like a black man in blackface. Every morning, I get disappointed by the most upvoted link in /r/wtf. One day, I will just unsubscribe :( Aww Man,  I have ADD, it's a serious problem, I can't get these damn Bitches to stop sniffing my crotch everywhere I go! And When I ... ohh what's this subreddit /r/dragonsfuckingcars ? Did...did you try it? Girl in the red: "oh shit, is that a dick?" i want that hat so badly now I have A.D.H.D. A deliciously huge dick. Could be worse honestly... awwwww yis That's very likely the blackest man I've ever seen... r/funny       yep Biggie Biggie Biggie, cant you see? Lets go red wings!!! Red Wings shirt? Have an upvote.  2321 points in 5 hours for this shit?!

How does this /r/Im14andthisisWTF bullshit rank higher than the guy nailing his own penis to a board?

You guys all upvoted because OP is a girl, didn't you? Really I have ADHD. A deliciously huge...duck...mmm yummy I just shuddered at the thought of taking the MBTA. You wouldn't abbreviate the A in "A Delicious Dick" as "A." since it's already only one letter.

Duh. Of course he is black His kids likely learned all about ADD when they were 5, so he doesn't care if your 10 year old daughter sees the hat.

Tribal scumbag, he is.   Said Yoda. YAY for the Green line in Seoul!
upvote for you sir or madam  My guess is it is not for shocking but rather for buzzing. Simply touching the knob will produce a sound. They are probably afraid of people walking in without them knowing.  LPT: Touch it with the back of your hand or a blade of grass to test if it's live.  If you touch it with your palm or grab it, you'll latch on and you'll have a bad time.

-Source: New Zealander.  We all know how to test an electric fence (and how [not to](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu_Plte-PbU))

Don't do this to test an obvious high power source... like, don't go climbing a pylon and hitting a 110kV line with the back of your hand. My mom has the same set up at home, she is in a scooter and tying a string to the knob is the only way she can pull the door closed behind her when she leaves Grandpa hasn't been the same since 'Nam, although he's not as subtle with the claymores these days. So this is where Kevin McCallister lives in his old age... It isn't electrified it is so their service dog can pull the door shut for them. What is it? They could be partially deaf and that illuminates a light so they know someone's at the door. Anyone else think of [this](http://imgur.com/PKyuxHO)? A guy in St Paul years ago took a bare wire and spanned it along his fence in a residential neighborhood and plugged it directly into a socket. When the neighbor died he got in trouble. r/elderlybeingdicks Anyone else think it's so they can pull the string and release the lever inside? Maybe it's harder for them to twist the knob then it is the spring the thumb lever on the inside? Perhaps it functions as a pulley system and opens the door from the inside making it easier on them? Looks like a bo................  if that loop were really electrified, you'd be dumb to put it on the outside doorknob. unless it's to keep someone inside... It's probably a runner for a dog to be put outside on. My grandmother used to do this. I see this all the time when I make deliveries. The person must be in a wheelchair in order to close the door from the outside.  Put.... Put your dick on it. What did you do? "I want to play a game..." My house's doorknob is electrified. Touch it without shoes on and you get a nice little jolt. We did it to keep the children at bay, lest they come in and steal our food. KEEEEVVVIIIINNNNNNNN!!!!!! Maybe they just had a loose tooth and like to do things the hard way. Well if anything you should find a dead critter and leave it at the door by the wire for the next man.  if you had to touch it use the back of your hand so your fingers don't clamp around it and kill yo self.  All these people talking about wires and I was sitting here thinking it was a tampon with a really long string, wtf brain. That looks like some Home Alone shit. That appears to be a Kevin McCallister rig Kevin McCallister's got shit on lockdown in that biz Touch it and then sue the old fucker Just get a rubber glove Did you try the bell, knock? I believe this is the McCallister residence. They're vacationing in Paris though, so the house is empty. Go on in! ALL SENIOR CITIZENS SHOULD HAVE LIFE ALERT Wow! Almost to the front page. It is funny because I told my coworker about the wire, and they said they had seen it but didn't think anything of it.  Metal door. [Ahhhhhhhhwowowowaaaaaah!!!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbzGibWoikA) I bet that person made their family disappear.  So even though it wasn't plugged in, can anyone actually explain what it did or how it works? Very clever Mrs. Esterhaus. I imagine the results were quite... Shocking? If you are wearing shoes this would do nothing to you. If you where bare foot on a rainy day how ever..... There's really no way that could shock you. 

You wouldn't be completing any circuits, assuming you're not barefoot on a wet door mat.

 Well I hope to hell her homeowners insurance is up to date. Some poor child selling cookies or wanting to get their ball that. Went into her yard! I really wish someone had the noodle to report this "booby trap" Highly dangerous and illegal without signage warning people. I can see her friend dropping by, touching the doorknob and blows up her pacemaker or makes her have a heart attack while trying to bring her some soup! if you're wearing shoes you're fine. can literally stick your keys into hot side of an outlet without the slightest worry after seeing the math. just dont touch anything else &gt;Heres my front door with wire attached to nothing Yea this looks so majestic and rare. ....better kill it Haven't these guys seen "Princess Mononoke"?!  You can't just go around killing forest spirits! I'm a prolific hunter, and I probably would have let this one walk...  "IT'S COMING RIGHT FOR US!" People are pretty pissed about it around here

http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/canada/nova-scotia/story/1.1928740
 I'm Canadian and hunt moose in the north. When I was young I saw an albino bull moose but we did not shoot it. We were friends with the natives in the area and they said it was extremely bad luck to kill a white moose to them. They don't fuck around up there and I believed them. It was weird because it was such a secluded region you would have thought you would have seen it again. Never did... ITT Redditors are totally cool shooting moose of color...but shoot a white moose and aawwwwww shit. Should have left that one alone  NOW we are fucked. not before. NOW. As someone who lives 500 miles north of Toronto, white moose are rare and NOBODY shoots them as far as I know as it is bad karma. Not being a native Canadian I am not sure of their significance in their culture, but it just seems wrong. I stopped hunting moose in 1982, and now hunt them with a camera. I have a feeling this fellow is a tourist.....not a regular, but hey I could be wrong. The guys who shot it didn't know its meaning to the natives and gave them the Moose for a ceremony and asked what they could do to help. 

I don't see how someone could kill something so beautiful and unique but at least they have remorse. 

Edit: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/albino-moose-killing-in-cape-breton-outrages-mi-kmaq-1.1928740 this is so sad. i'm an avid hunter, but i also believe in conservation, herd management and ethical hunting practices. albino animals are so rare. the local governing body is responsible for this Not anymore it doesn't Figures it would be killed. *protected the forests Hey! That guy looks like the Will it Blend guy.

"Ooh! Legendary animal smoke... don't breathe this." I just heard a bit about this on the radio the other day. The hunter was contacted by a native organization and was unaware of the spiritual significance of the animal. He is cooperating with the natives fully to return the hide so it many be used in a three day ritual to honor the slain beast. What a cunt! ಠ_ಠ WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW CANADIAN ABORIGINES? In my state it is illegal to take any albino deer. Doing so results in a fine and mandatory surrender of the animal to the state. It is legal to take white or albino deer in CWD management zones as the animals are just as likely to contract the disease. It's a shame that such a beautiful creature like that was killed by someone who probably just wanted to kill it because it was unique and special. Never fails. Its always a white guy in his 50s or 60s with too much time and money on his hands.  So is the forest fucked now? Checks out, he is a bad guy.  Turns out he has been going after moose and squirrel for some time now Wow so rare.  i'm defiantly saving this picture.  As an avid hunter, I don't think I could ever shoot an albino moose. I would be in complete awe. It's not like he had any predators aside from humans, so his color during the summer wouldn't be as big of an issue as it would be for say a deer or a rabbit. And I think I would question the shot on an albino moose with a rack like that regardless of being aware of native traditions, did he think the moose grew that big being lucky? Well great. You've gone and fucked the forests Jim. These guys have the entire native population of Nova Scotia out for their blood. They straight fucked up. 
Source: I'm in Nova Scotia OMG ITS SO PRETTY WHY COULDNT HE JUST KILL AN UGLY ONE It's OK to shoot blacks, but not whites, the natives said it. As a Canadian I have never heard this but it sounds rediculous so I guess the story checks out  ITT: people who don't understand wild game. AKA liberal pusses. 

 As someone who grew up hunting, I would not have taken that animal under any circumstances.  Instead I would have appreciated how lucky I was to see it and then move on. I hate humans... Ugh, I hate those *let me sit on this dead thing I just killed* pictures.  Is that the hunting equivalent of gamers' teabagging? That douchenozzle. I hunt, not for sport though, this guys a dick, something like that does not need to die, the fact that it survived to adulthood growing up with no natural camo is a miracle, but this guy, this guys a dick Trigger happy piece of shit. And you killed it! Good one asshole Brutal. Lame fucker... This makes me sad. Oh, come on. Did you have to kill that one? Really? and this asshole killed it, fucking jerk.
 I know nothing about hunting. Why would someone hunt a moose in general? I eat a lot of exotic meats and I've never even seen Moose available. Is it palatable? Oh shit, prepare for the night walker.... Oh there's a great white moose that protects the forest LETS FUCKING KILL IT!  Seeing this deeply saddens me.  What an idiot, even if you hunt you don't kill something unique like that. I'm a hunter, and hunting is for the sole purpose of the meat. Obviously, shooting RARE ANIMALS is a lame as fuck thing to do, so fuck this guy. Of course there's the entire journey of going about it. IMO, every single hunter I know and have hunted with aren't "trophy hunters". We are constantly aware of the animals coming and going through our acres, and believe me, we tend to LEAVE the bigger ones so they can reproduce and thrive. I love animals, but this is a way of life. We eat meat everyday, but people just cannot wrap their minds around killing something to eat it.  what the fuck is a canadian aborigine?  a black guy with a boomerang that says "eh"? This is fucking sad. That guy should be ashamed.  So what is it that protects the meese? Canadian aborigines = first nations. TYL Most awesome moose ever. Death sounds like a good penalty for being a fricken pimp moose.  Canadian Aboroigines?! that's the most offensive thing I have ever heard Not protecting sh!t now! Take that First Peoples! why would you kill that?! This is not world of warcraft. YOU DON'T KILL RARES IRL I haven't heard Mi'kmaq referenced since watching Pet Semetary, wonder if they are one and the same. Weird how your brain keeps those tidbits for years. the forest spirit from princess mononoke *Please* let this be fake. All of it. Sooo...this guy killed something that protects the forests? I can only imagine what smokey the bear is thinking about that one. Here's a story on a Spirit Bear shot in AK.

http://juneauempire.com/stories/062708/sta_296264739.shtml Protection is overrated. I wonder if it had a family? If so, where can I hunt them? fUCK THIS GUY! Albin all over again. Poor Norway... [Satw](http://satwcomic.com/wild-ghost) I am a hunter, and fuck that guy. And the fucker killed it.... Ah yes, the Canadian *Aborigines* They later apologised, so at least there's that Canada aborigines? You just fucked all of canada. Thanks.

Source: im canadian Most likely on a farm or ranch. Albino animals rarely survive to adulthood. This was probably a caged hunt. He probably paid an insane amount to shoot it. Protects his fireplace now. 'Agreed to give over the hide', I wouldn't say that was out of remorse.  The shows him sitting on it, with a shit eating grin while showing the width of its majestic antlers, he wanted that trophy, fucking greedy bastard. Fuck this guy!  Okay, they got the white moose out of the way, it's safe to bring in the frackers. My Hero...  As a hunter myself... He is a friggin' idiot... Stupid... Stupid... Stupid... And the white man kills it... and a redneck had to kill it Well now the forest is fucked I guess... And now its dead, and the forest is doomed.. And this douchebag killed it. I don't think the guy had any idea, but it's common sense not to kill something that looks that unique. Aaaaaannnnd its dead. Nope, Chuck Testa! I don't get it, is there a curse attached to his or something?? Well, forests are screwed now. Good work buddy. That's right. That man is doomed.  Sure doesn't protect the forests anymore. Thats one Canadian i say fuck you to. Assuming he is Canadian Dude.  What a cunt. This guy is the definition of cunt. Well, the forests are fucked now. No, you killed the moose! I love moose... :'( Someone should shoot and mount that son of a bitch!

 so this asshole killed it

great What a shit fuck... take a pic don't kill it I'll never understand hunters that kill rare things. It takes all kinds of crazy/stupid. You know.... people are just stupid.... certain things you let go man...  Who kills majestic creatures?  Fucking asshole this reminds me of the movie Princess Mononoke when the forest spirit is killed. Yeah why don't you just kill a white moose. What can go wrong I would've shot it. If you see a legal moose, you shoot it. No use spending more time hunting than needed. I am considering my words carefully as I type this. I would like to see this man tortured in front of his family.
 Isn't killing albinos illegal Somebody needs to shoot him...he has white hair  Aborigines? Wtf, dude? Seriously? reminds me of the Matrix, where the guy described us as a virus. should shoot that guy instead
 Fuck that guy!
 Not anymore. I feel like that moose shouldn't of been shot  Canadian aborigines? lol Anyone who would shoot an animal like this should be shot themselves. Canadian forests are fucked now. Not protecting much now. This is sad! At least until some dickless turd goes and kills it. really!? something that beautiful deserves to live so everyone can see it Wish they fined guys like this. Bad karma.  http://i.imgur.com/1JtA1zh.png For all the people saying it was messed up to kill it it wouldve died anyway since it has no camo and judging by the lush green forest floors, it couldn't have lived long enough. Hey you no what they say white meat is always better for you than dark meat. Fucking Prick those are extremely rare Douche bag probably wanted it for the mount not the meat. Harvest its dna and release clones into the wild and this man's house. Womp womp...  I'd say the hunter had a lucky day and  maybe the albino moose spirit works in mysterious ways so who are they to be upset the moose was killed. Like they know what the spirits are thinking Big no no to shoot albino game in the woods I grew up in. There WAS a Great White moose until that jackass killed it. If you must hunt, hunt humans. Proud Hick -10,000 karma points for the hunter. Better make a trophey so you can prove to everyone how douchy you are. Whoever shot this should be given a plaque congratulating him on helping with the extinction of white moose. Fuckin retard. I've heard many aborigines believe in albino animals to be walking spirits, that may have protected them. First time I heard this was of a bear, an albino brown bear living in the forests... Dude needs to get cancer. Yeah what the fuck is a Canuck aborigine ? They are called Native Canadians, im not even native and dont care but fuck man c'mon. Who is going to protect the forest now? This will be the one thing Canadians get mad at Better post something before the anti-hunter circle jerk comme- ^^^^oh Well, not anymore! And of course an old white man killed it! What the hell is a Canadian aborigines?  this protected them, hunter fail, now canada will fall......
 not anymore it doesn't! Andddd we killed it  Kinda like killing a spirit beast in warcraft... :( sad though.. I hope he knows that killing a white moose doesn't by any chance make him a better hunter. especially since it stands out so much in a dark forest yah until the douche bag who shot him... probably an American And some Jackass, probably American tourist had to go and shoot the fucking thing. I hope when he is eating his waffle house in the he can call Sarah Palin and tell her to expect some meat in the mail. Does anyone know a source? I would like to know this hunters name, or a way to contact him. I really just want to know why?  It "protected" the forest till some dumb dude killed it...man i love this country Not anymore.  [r/rage](http://www.reddit.com/r/rage) I'd rather them kill any other moose than this one it looks so pure and majestic.... That damn rat bastard... Hope he gets antlers or whatever those things on tip of mooses  heads are called shoved up his ass so far they become his teeth Yeah, you don't want to fuck around with Ford Rangers.   Was told it was caused by stress from heating the windscreen.  Wow, how did that truck get way up there? Pilots must have been shitting bricks as their front windshield started to crackle and pop. That shoe is really doing some damage today! Did you die? [You should have taken it to Safelite before that chip turned into a crack.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfn5hMQYJ4o) I'm not a pilot, but it looks to me like a pretty good reason to make an emergency landing.   Did you drop it? I bet you had the case off didn't you. Gorilla Glass? More like gorilla ass. The planes windshield heat failed that's why it cracked. The windshield is usually heated pretty hot to make the glass more pliable if some thing were to strike it. How long does it take to get a pilate license and how much does it cost?

Edit: Pilot not pilate.. W.e im leaving it.. I dont even wanna know any more.. Shit like that, gives me frisson. Did that Ranger take the pilot's parking spot? If you rework your title to something like, "Experimental test flight using a man-made compound eye", you can probably get a government grant large enough to buy the airport. I've seen this before...dragons. Well, the truck looks fine. How the hell did it hit you way up there anyways? That must have been one fucking huge bug! Seems legit.  are your pants wet ? You better call Henry Ford. 'Cause you're in the Ranger zone. "It's like raaaiii-iiiaaaaannnnnn.....on your wedding day!"
 Where are you flying out next ? 

I'll make sure we don't go together. "Hello, this is your captain speaking. There is absolutely no cause for alarm." It usually happens on our aircrafts when someone forgets to turn off the windshield heater. For some reason that glass is making my skin crawl... wait. you haven't flown in 18 years and this was your first flight? or this is the first time in 18 years that you've ever experienced a windshield mishap? or that you've ever had an emergency landing? A British Airways pilot was sucked out of the window when it failed - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways_Flight_5390 Does the pattern on the windshield creep anyone out?  I feel a tingly feeling in my head from it... grr Something Something Shoe that's why i don't buy my plane from craigslist. It's a rather beautiful pattern.... damn, nice save What is going on this pic? Well quit bitching every time a chicken is fired from a cannon at a window to test it.

 What? Did ASIG forget to fuel your plane? Fucking Spiderman. Call safelite.  Lawl I don't see what the problem is Are you complaining because you would have preferred to stay in the air? Because looking at the picture, I think the pilots made the right call here. Who else works for asig Birds?
 Copilot dont need to see shit. You could say his vision of a perfect flight was...*shattered.* *He waited his whole damn life to take that flight*

*And as the plane crashed down he thought*

*"Well isn't this nice..."*

*And isn't it ironic... don't you think* As someone who flies planes professionally in GTAV, Im surprised your plane didn't explode on impact. I'm a pilot, did you get a bird, hail, leave windshield anti ice on? Excuse me, but the rules say "No Screenshots!".  This is clearly a shot of your screen! wasn't JAL flight 9 out of Chicago was it? C'mon Walter, this the like the 5th time Relatively common and usually harmless. 

Source: imma pilot  You've gotta watch out for Fords. Thing is barely scratched. At least you were saved by Spider-Man. Murphy's law. OP? OP please respond... RIP in peace OP Yawn. Did the cabin depressurization? Was the copilot sucked out? No? Then you should take this as a good demonstration of the safety, redundancy, and fault tolerance built into modern airplanes. This should inspire confidence.  I flew for the first time not too long ago and our airplane had to turn around and make an emergency landing because the one engine failed and the other was on its way out.

Fly on an airplane they said, it's the safest mode of transportation they said u hit that truck? What altitude did you encounter that truck? Might have been the problem.You were 'flying' in a parking lot. Bullshit. There is no way they let you in the cockpit to take a picture. It looks like you've hit a bird.  I can tell because of the feather-shaped cracking in the windshield, and from seeing quite a few birds in my time. I don't care. Pretty smart hooker.

Hooker flags people down saying she ran out of gas.  Guys pull over and she says she doesn't have any money for gas, gives blowjob or whatev for money. 

You should charge her rent for using the jeep.  My guess is somebody is claiming the vehicle is theirs and that they are out of gas. They use it to flag down possible johns/marks on the side of the road and then sleep with/rob them somewhere else. It may seem you have a hooker infestation Your Jeep is a hooker and is allowing men to fuck its gas line for money. Just for further clarification. Nobody has gained access to the vehicle. I always keep it locked and alarmed. I thought maybe someone siphoned gas, but that was not the case either. Are they having sex on top of the car? They are using it as an excuse to get in the car without the cops up their ass.

Cops:  Why did you get in the car?

Hooker:  I wasn't prostituting, he was just giving me a ride to the gas station.

Cops:  Ok hooker

Hooker:  Slurp They said scam so that would most likely mean no one is getting any action. My guess is it's the spot they're sending the potential clients to.   *Sincerely,

Dirty Mike and The Boys Strange... Just earlier this summer I was at the gas station filling up as a really attractive girl (probably about 25) approached me. She gave me some elaborate story about how she left her wallet and cell phone somewhere and was super low on gas and needed $10 to get where she was going. Immediately I was sketched out. But it was broad daylight so I was like what the hell... I told her I didn't have any cash but offered to go into the station (to the register) and pay for $10 worth of gas for her on my credit card. She looked at me as if I was a moron but agreed to my offer. 

The whole situation was extremely tense and awkward as if one of us wasn't understanding what was going on and its been bothering me ever since. Then I saw this post. Is it possible I was being solicited for sex? Was she a regular person just being honest? Who knows... But I guess after seeing this post it would seem that I bought a hooker $10 worth of gas... that is all.  Sounds like that scene from "The Other Guys" - Thanks for the F-Shack   It's a JEEP thing, you wouldn't understand... * Hide out of sight
* Wait until hooker is blowing customer behind car
* Trigger the car alarm 'panic mode'
* Hooker is startled, chomps down on customer's cock
* Hilarity ensues If someone is screwing with your gas cap, I would suggest you purchase a [lockable one.](https://www.google.com/search?q=lockable+gas+cap&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nDNUUq62M8rgqAHB1oHoAQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=799&amp;dpr=1)  They don't cost too much and it will prevent them from messing with your tank if they aren't already.  Are the siphoning gas from you?  If not, I'd still get one of these.

Edit: Spelling There's semen in your gas tank. The Jeep is tall enough and in a secluded area that allows a john to hide by the side of the car with his car parked behind to look like he is "helping" put gas in your car. Hooker has a gas can to make it all look legit. 
You're welcome. Recycle it - again. This napkin is made with 100% recycled content and at least 40 % post-consumer fiber, helping save more than 86,381 trees since 2009. So use it, then recycle it - you are doing a lot more than just keeping your chin clean. Tempted to use my arduino and make a red light like a camera and put a sign up from the inside that says something along the lines of, "This hooker infestation is being monitored." OP, here's what's happening: she's telling dudes she doesn't have gas money and her jeep's out of gas, then she takes them back to your jeep where she does her 'thing.'  Now some might advise you to call the cops.  Some might advise you to demand a cut from her.  But here's my advise: 

Install a hidden camera near your jeep and follow the John's back to their car.  Get their license plates. ID them.  Then send them prints of them getting it on with a hooker.  Then extort the bejesus out of them.  Threaten them with sending the video to their wives/bosses whatever.  Set up an anonymous money transfer online so they'll never know who's extorting them. If you have a soft top, maybe she is fucking inside your jeep, and the gas cap was unscrewed by the note leaver to get your attention. Or maybe a hanging gas cap is like a tie on a doorknob. Or maybe your Jeep is a whore and the gas line is where she let's other cars, and possibly Transformers and/or Go-Bots, insert their units. Who knows, this world is crazy.  I missed the "scam" part of the note and thought it said "Your car is being used for a hooker, be aware its being used at night" and since the gas cover was open and unscrewed, it meant that someone was charging people to put their dicks in your gas tank. Its 2013, I'm sure some weirdo is into that.  [This man was seen leaving the vicinity of your car last night](http://i.minus.com/ixfIwGwqwbecF.gif) Least hobos aren't using it as a soup kitchen (go ahead and look that up) Seems like Dirty Mike and the boys got a hold of your car and used it as an F-Shack Set up a microphone or camera in the jeep to see wtf is going on, upload it to youtube and give us the link!

I'd like to hear how exactly it goes from I need gas to lets do sexual things for money. You're being set up.

1. take the gas from the car, leave cap unscrewed.

2. after some time passed [a couple of days], a note will appear "Hey, we were the guys taking your gas the other day. Our car had ran out and we desperately needed the fuel. We're very sorry to have inconvenienced you. To make it up for you, we're giving you a full tank of gas and these tickets to the [venue name]

3. When you use the tickets, you're out of the house on a set date. When you come back, your house is empty because they know you wouldn't be home that day Yeah this has happened to me before. Woman flagged me down and asked if I had $20 for gas, I said no, and she goes "can I earn $20?" You should stay in your jeep all night until she brings a guy back there and then jump out in a mask and scream to scare them off. Problem solved. I recommend dressing as a scarecrow and calling yourself a scareho. Please stay up one night and watch your car to see what happens and post pics. 

OP will surely not be a fag. Report nothing. Buy a trail cam, point it at your car and see what's going on. [Car Fuckers](http://videosift.com/video/Kids-In-The-Hall-Car-Fuckers) I don't know why but my first reaction was to think they were telling guys your gas tank was a glory hole. Its a Starbucks napkin... Look there! We are gonna have sex in your car! It will happen again! I have the best idea. 
1. Go to ATM
2. Withdraw 20.00
3. Get BJ
4. When she finishes, pull out keys
5. Get in your jeep and drive off into the sunset.  It's probably just Dirty Mike and the boyz Update: seeing as I don't have a camera nor do I want to sit outside and watch my car all night (I have work lol). I'm going to park the Jeep in a spot within view of my balcony for the next few weeks instead of my assigned carport spot. As much as I would like to setup cameras that stream from my car for Reddit to monitor, I do not have the equipment or the funds to set that up :(. I filed an incident report with the apartment and if I know any thing else I will pursue further action. If anything else happens I will let you guys know. Than you all for the advice and insights, it was greatly appreciated. The  local   hookers  are  using your  Jeep  to fuck and  suck   their  customers ..  Like a  mini  hotel room. But  for  FREE .. So  your  Jeep  is  now  a  Cum bucket .. 
 "Thanks for the fuck-shack"

-Dirty Mike and the boys http://i.imgur.com/yNrhzDj.jpg 

this might be your car My guess, hookers are acting like they are "out of gas" to get the attention of a male, then fucking their brains out right there on the spot, and then leaving you with the deposit... Someone is pimping out your car's gas-hole. I think it means that your car is a whore, a dirty american whore. I suggest a hidden video camera to, er, get to the climax of this story.. Looks like you have a soup kitchen on your hands. *Signed Dirty Mike and the Boys*. The hooker fucks someone against your car and they cum inside the gas hole The prostitute is scamming the John's by telling them she has a Honda, but it's actually a JEEP. "Thanks -dirty mike and the boys" I believe this sort of thing happened to George Costanza. Probably some tweakers who syphoned your gas and wrote that note when they were fucked up because its hilarious It means Dirty Mike and the Boys are having a sex party in your car.. Time for a stakeout with some paintball guns at the ready? She flags people down at the road/entrance and then brings them back to where the Jeep is to show them.  It's secluded, so she can do her business right there in the back of the complex.  It wouldn't make sense to do it on the main road. Pimp My Ride They make writing on chipotle napkins look easy. Buy a locking gas cap. Problem solved. I think Dirty Mike and The Boys are at it again Call Nicolas Cage!  Probably just Dirty Mike and the Boys It's a Jeep thing, you wouldn't understand. My money is is on a schitzophrenic left the note. Then put his cock in your gas tank.  Sounds like it's time for a stake out One thing left to do...  Pimp your ride. 

I'll show myself out  It could mean she's fucking guys in your jeep, they are pretty easy to get into. It's like that episode of Seinfeld... Signed: Dirty Mike and the boys People are draping a realistic blowup doll over your gas cap and unsuspecting Johns are fucking your jeep. Big mike n the boys are having a soup kitchen People are fucking in your car, bro. A summary of other posts:
1) Locking gas cap. Everyone should have one by now.
2) Black Light the interior, but only if you don't use your jeep that way.
3) Hidden Camera, just make sure you don't get caught by it. 
Now mine:
Notify local Police, if they are not in on it, they will increase their area patrols in your neighborhood.
2) Talk to the neighbors. Maybe you'll find a hook-up. Just don't use your jeep.
3) Inspect your jeep (black light excluded) Is the plate on it yours? Lug nuts tight etc... record mileage for a while.
Finally: don't try to understand the behavior, it will drive you nuts, which is maybe the point of all this.   She may be after money for drugs, so the gas is her first course, as both an excuse for the man, and as a fable for the johns. Sex is the last resort, fail safe. Until a guy refuses anyway, at which point she gets all violent and shit and kills the poor guy right besides your jeep, and then rides off with his car to buy her crack before she slams it into a barricade in a drug fueled rampage.  "my car ran out of gas could you help me out with a few dollar so i can get it home?"  Who cares about the note, I'm just glad that napkin is on 100% recycled paper. I have a feeling im going to see this on fb soon with a bogus story to it. Title "ladies beware!" I was hoping the note said

*Thanks
            ~ from Dirty Mike and the boys* go watch Seinfeld Season 7 Episode 19. theres an entire subplot with George and Kramer that should explain things. 

"George and Kramer have begun parking their cars at a discount parking lot (Jiffy Park) because their rates are so low. However, after picking his car George discovers a condom inside and suspects that the rates are low because prostitutes are servicing their clients inside the cars. The lot is unable to retrieve Kramer's own car for him, but, to placate him, offers him the use of another customer's Mary Kay pink Cadillac Eldorado. George sticks around to see whether the suspicious women hanging around are actually prostitutes. He offers one of them money for information, but is caught by Susan who assumes he is unfaithful."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wig_Master None of these theories are plausible.Not the running out of gas to give a bj scam, or the robbery scam, or the serial crusher scam. 

Someone got drunk, took off your gas cap, and left this note. At the time, it probably seemed to them like the funniest thing that has ever happened. CTRL+F - "dirty Mike and the boys" is it a wrangler? and if so, do you keep it unlocked? i know that many people with wranglers leave them unlocked to prevent stabs/punctures to the plastic windows and soft top, so maybe it is literally being used for sexy times Dirty mike and the boys are having a soup kitchen The hooker isn't using a gas can or the need for gas as a prop, she's selling blow jobs and letting a John steal the gas from a vehicle she claims is hers.

“I’ll give you a blowjob and five gallons of gas for $20” or “I’ll give you 5 gallons of gas and a blowjob for $20”

She probably knows where every vehicle without a locking gas cap is parked for miles. She’s a lowlife and is giving lowlifes tons of blowjobs and gas, son. Get your car vaccinated, just in case. Well, obviously there is a hooker in your gas tank that services men when they put their penis into your gas tank. **You car is being used for a hooker scam.**

**Be aware it's being used at night.** Dirty Mike and the boys? Maybe you could make some money on the side. Maybe they'll give you the owners discount. Do you stick to the seats? That's some cool handwriting Someone fucked your Jeep. Right in the gas hole. I think it means your car is being used in a hooker scam. Just sayin.  You actually have to flip it upside down... the note is in the small, black computer-type. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1j4mK6cs_A Someone has been sticking their dick in your Jeep. This is how it goes.....

The hooker gets some desperate guy to try and do it outdoors by the car. It's dark, she puts one leg on the bumper and bends over on the car, then guides the guy into the gas tank. When the deed is done she gets paid and literally has done nothing but helped a man have sex with your open gas tank. 

 I had a co-worker call me late at night and give me the out of gas story. I got dressed, went and filled up a 2 gallon gas can and drove to where she said her car stopped near her apartment. When I get near she doesn't answer. 15 minutes later, someone helped her get her car home and she tells me to go ahead and come by. I go over and pour the gas in her car. She hugs me. I walk away. She laughs. I think she wanted the D. Fuck. Don't get a locking gas cap. Stake it out and see what happens. Post video here. Jiffy park? Mount some hidden cameras in your Jeep and leave the doors unlocked. See if she decides to take her business in there. Say hello to your first subscriber. I have never opened my fuel door to prove to someone that I'm out of gas... Someone flagged me down with a sob story like this once... I just gave her money. I did't think about her reciprocating in some way. :( I'm assuming they make it look like they've run out of petrol, flag down a car and ask for "help". So they find cars with accessible petrol tanks, in case they're questioned by the Po-leece It's just explaining that the paper has already been recycled before and informing you on how great a decision it would be to do your part and recycle it again. Could she be scamming people in your apartment complex? Seems as though they want you to recycle the napkin. Are you parking in a private lot in NY? Is your name Kramer?  It means, time to take a black light to your car. Dirty Mike and the boys. It means that it's time to invest in a locking gas cap.  Reddit has made me so skeptical so I think the note means OP needs to work on his handwriting  Are you parking it at a Jiffy-Park? It's only a scam if she takes the money/gas but doesn't *perform*.

This is the internet. Why am I being obtuse? If the hooker doesn't hook, it's a scam. There. I think someone had sex with your car Its called a soup kitchen. Really gross stuff. "From bodily fluids and hair samples, we've determined that a bunch of old homeless dudes had an orgy in there"
 Nanny cam that shit. Put a Post-It note near the filler that says, "I have you in the sights of my deer rifle.  Leave now." new season of pimp my ride. nothing to be worried about OP is a liar. He doesn't have a Jeep, he owns a [Mercury Mistress](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qe_-MrKaoU&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6Qe_-MrKaoU) I actually read that as "Your cat is being used for a hooker scam"   Just be glad its not a note from Dirty Mike and the boys OP. your car is being used as a big cum box. sorry dudeman I can see you getting free blowjobs out of this. Tell her you won't tell the cops for a nightly blowjob. Everybody wins. Except the hooker, because she's a hooker.  "thanks for the F shack - Dirty mike and the boys" I was expecting lots of Dirty Mike and the Boys jokes.  I don't get where the scam bit comes in. Prostitution isn't a scam on it's own so where does e car fit into this? Is she far away from the vehicle and saying that there is someone in monitoring her and the johns? Maybe she is telling them her pimp or even the police are in the car and trying to get more money out of them or they will come kick his ass or arrest him or whatever. Or maybe it is to scam hookers. A John approaches her, maybe tells her there are police in the jeep or something and demands a bribe? Or maybe he just throws gasoline on her and lights her on fire. Your Jeep is now known as a "Soup Kitchen."  Haha set up a camera, see what happens, maybe she's popping the lock and banging them in your jeep... :-/
do you have a soft or hard top? They fucked your jeep Maybe her alternate personality left the note. "That's no hooker, it's a jeep.  Better leave a note." As entertaining an idea it is that the hooker is using your jeep as a prop to cleverly sell blow jobs..

In order for this to be a scam, someone has to be getting scammed.

Hooker lures John to your car and her pimp or colleagues rob him in a conveniently dark location secluded from attention and prying eyes.

Gas cap off was to get your attention and find the note. You have a soft top on that Jeep?  If so, he/she's probably unzipped it, got inside, and starting fucking people in it.   Probably because you got sucked and fucked! don't post on reddit, call police and have them setup a sting instead to catch the hooker It was Dirty Mike and the boys Love, Dirty Mike and the Boyz. Sounds like you should put a video camera somewhere on your jeep.. free porn? Lol Sounds like a hooker is standing next to your car at night and charging men to put their dicks in your gas cap. Sting OP. FLIR, NVG's n shit... sneaking through the shadows style stealth... Surveillance. Mid act of jeep desecration... "HEY! Gimme my back rent HOE!" Give how the backhand of the gods... 

you are now a pimp.  Man that is terrible! Where does that even happen? I mean where do you even live? ....Like specifically, how do I get to your parking lot?  Spray the car for crabs or better yet, set fire to it and start over. We call that a "soup kitchen." Sounds like they are trying to hit you with the old "hooker scam" scam. Dirty Mike and the boys Buy a locking gas cap. set up a trail cam , have a good laugh  I'm guessing that hooker is slang for tow truck--I can't pinpoint it to a region, but I know I've heard it.  The scam probably involves needing to pay or wait for a tow truck.  The hookers are pretending to be out of gas so that men stop to help?? Dude, you need to take your car and have it tested for chlamydia.  Maybe a guy fucks your gas tank.... Set up a camera then post the pics for the karma. Waiting for the 'hooker here!' comments to ensue Get a locking gas cap?
 Yup...somebody is haveing sex with your car There is so much potential here! OP you have to either 
A. Catch a blowjob for "gas money" transaction on camera
B. Blackmail/extort some dude like some people are saying
C. Hit the panic button while one of these transactions are going down (on camera of course) 
D. Charge her rent/ pimp her out
E. Confront her in a way that you get a couple free blowjobs a week! (Probably best option)
F. Meet her and drive her around yourself, pimping her out from the Jeep, then use her to help you start a rap career and if you get arrested have her act as your agent to push your music while in prison
- whatever it is OP, let us know what happens!

 Signed,
Dirty mike and the boys Somebody is putting their penis in your gas tank at night. Where exactly is it parked? I could use a blowie Thanks.  This is the funniest thing I've seen all day. at least it was written on recycled paper Ah I see you have met dirty mike I think it was Dirty Mike and the boys.  They mean a fucking hooker scam Enjoy sitting in herpes. You need a dash cam. thanks for the F shack
- dirty mike and the boyz Probably a scam relating to being out of gas and trying to get people to give something for free or someshit. 
Source: I'm a detective Sincerely,      Dirty Mike and The Boys. From dirty mike and the boys.  No harm is coming out of her just saying she's out of gas and using your car as a prop. If I were you I'd wait out one night and just tell her to close it back up afterwards. And possibly get a quick bj for allowing her to use it. He cam in your gas tank possibly? 'Thanks for the F shack' signed dirty Mike and the boys' lmao Hooker infestation, I suggest setting the vehicle to flames before it spreads. Seinfeld episode using parking lot vehicles for extra curricular activities. They are suffering from mental illness I think.  [dirty mike strikes again](http://imgur.com/rpLLiks) I think Dirty Mike and the boys are having a screw party in your jeep. Hooker: Hey Sir! I ran out of gas, could you help me out? I don't have money but I am sure we could work something out.

John: Uhmm....... ok hop aboard

Hooker: Well in reality all I need is about threefiddy

John: I AIN'T GOT NO THREEFIDDY! DAMN LOCKNESS MONSTER!!!!!!!!!
 On the upside, this hooker got me a bunch of karma!!! Dirty Mike and the boys used it as a "Soup Kitchen". Leave condoms near car.

Poke hole in all condoms.


Revenge Sorry op, looks like your vehicle has been marked for use by Dirty Mike and boys. It must be Dirty Mike and the boys.  So, what really happened is somebody was siphoning gas out of your Jeep last night, probably a young lady and probably under the cover of night.

So, she's kneeling down next to your vehicle, making sucking motions, siphoning your fuel and the guy, who is probably the paranoid sort, figures hookers are using the side of your car to do their business. My guess would be is that your car is being used for a hooker scam A hooker scam, as opposed to a legitimate hooker transaction. The note was actually written by the hooker as part of the scam.  Tonight, when you come back to check on the car to see WTF is happening with your gas cap, a "helpful lady" will come out to report on the happenings.  Next thing you know... you'll have your gas cap unzipped and she'll be pumping your nozzle.  Or something. Your Jeep is the hooker. They're sticking their dick in your car. Dirty mike and the boys strike again Thanks for the eff shack.  Love, dirty mike and the boys Thanks for the F-Shack. 
-Dirty Mike and the Boys Respectfully,

-Dirty Randy and the Boys Signed: Dirty Mike and the Boys [That correct usage of "your" though.](http://i.imgur.com/7OoMEJs.gif) Am I the only one here who thought people were jizzing in his tank? [Relevant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=NqUHRgleRk0#t=67) Someone is having sex with your car. Maybe its a joke. Or some bored kids thought leaving that note would be funny. Hide in your jeep and watch. You should get the standard 12% of each BJ. It's George Costanza's car! Somebody is charging money to pork your poor Jeep right in its fuel hole. The guy who wrote the note probably felt bad about leaving jizz droplets on your upholstery. Atleast it's not a soup-kitchen They fucked your car bro! I saw this episode on Seinfeld once. That means people have ejaculated in your car. I would be black lighting my Jeep if I got that note. Hopefully you locked your vehicle! 
 Did you fall for it on Saturday, then again on Sunday, then twice on Monday? It sounds like a bad porno. "I've broken down and have no money for gas, would you like a blowjob?" Get a locking gas cap. They have them at Autozone Pep Boys et al. some dirty dirty bitch has been sucking dick in your car.  and I thought I was having a bad day, but at least strangers didn't fuck in my car lol My first though: hey it's a Starbucks napkin  She's boning grody old men inside your jeep dude.  Siphon some gas please. Now tickle the balls. That looks like a Round Table napkin, if that helps any. Get a camera, film her in action, call the police let them know, show them evidence when she denies. huehuehuehue Whet do you live? I have gas.  How old is this Jeep? I haven't seen a car for fifteen years which didn't have a locking fuel flap and/or filler cap. Put a hidden cam inside pointing at the back gas cap... let's see what's up! Perhaps set up a camera to watch? Or better yet watch it yourself, with a few items handy of course... Put a camera watching the car and see if its true Get a locking gas door good buddy. Know what it's called when they do that in there?? A soup kitchen...  Just be glad they arn't using the inside of the car. Buy a motion detecting trail camera and deliver results! Credit or debit? Cocaine psychosis? I think they mean you should recycle that napkin. Obviously means the person who wrote the note likes starbucks! Is it really a scam?

She's not scamming anyone out of anything. I think i found the...the [whore](http://imgur.com/Mh49Axn).  I didn't know this was a scam.... some chick tried to use this on me in Tennessee! Maybe she's using your Jeep as a cover. I mean act like you're doing something. Help her, get banged for your buck. Seems like your car is having more fun than you. Wasn't their a Seinfeld episode like this?  Anyway, maybe the jeep is easy to access. Maybe it has a broken door. I would imagine that it's a lot easier for a hooker to ply her trade in a big roomy Jeep than in a Mini Cooper. That looks a lot like schizophrenia to me. You need Kramer's Technicolor coat and walking cane. Turn, pimp! Someone is fucking your gas tank through that opening, and paying someone else for the privilege.   You've been warned! At least it's not a Soup Kitchen  im not sure, but im pretty sure u might have a gas tank full of semen OP. Brought to you by Starbucks. Maybe it's possible someone is just messing with you... Just hide and watch and record one night.  Damnit, now i have to find another car hookers can "suck a golfball thru a gardenhose"...maby they also "suck gasoline out the tank"..!
Gasoline is very profitable on the black market. It means you Jeep now has an STD and will possibly be the central evidence at a trial in the future. Maybe someone is pimping your car as a hooker and having johns have intercourse with it through the gas cap. Lol.  Get a couple of dash cams and place them strategically around the car Maybe she sells her body for gas and puts it in your car.jokes on the guy who had sex with her, she didn't need the gas. Surely an effective hooker would attract clientele. She must be discount quality if she has to scam people back to ur car. Hah, classic hooker scam. If hookers were smart, they would be hiding for a few months after GTA came out Mercury Mistress! Locking filler cap ftw Uhh, someone is siphoning your gas bro. Why don't you fill up the tank after you get your free BJ...tell her you insist on filling it up instead of giving her money. ..when she disagrees just hit the unlock button on your keychain Watch out! There's a felon's claw on that g! It means you need to hang out by your car at night more  You gonna need a Precious Roy Scare Hooker: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nZX51VSKIVA#t=485 It's one of your friends.  People are either f-ing in ur cAr or using it as a place to meet..hints the gas cap being a signal for the coast is clear :-) Protip- Smell the napkin. means you need to get a new car Quite a sticky mess OP has on his hands.... and his Upholstery.  Please tell me your gas gauge is higher than it was the night before sometimes. That shit would be awesome. I'm going to buy a jeep.  I think everyone is missing the possibility that his jeep is being used AS the hooker. Speaking of hooker scams, I just thought of one.

Guy has kinky hooker sex in his car while her accomplices siphon his gas. She gets paid for her services, *and* gets free gas. Badda bing badda boom. Well, I've got a pretty good idea as to *what it means*, strictly speaking; I just don't even. Did I missed something? Having your gas tank open is an international sign for an empty gas? Don't use a black light inside your car, you are gonna get freaked out... Just stay up late and randomly hit the panic button. I would say that this a warning from a fellow neighbor who witnessed your car being used for some kind of sex scandal ring that involves your gas tank and the hole in question!!! I have to give props to the good samaritan warning you about hooker-related activities, that person's grammar was on point. Step 1: Acquire $40, fake beard and two vehicles, from friends. It's midnight on Tuesday, their not going anywhere.
Step 2: Get first blow job, lose $20, drive to second car.
Step 3: Drive second car, get second blow job, lose $20, take off fake beard for recognition purposes, reveal identity of Jeep owner and discuss business plan.
Step 4: ??????
Step 5: Profit wonder if she does the jeep wave to get them to pull over? this isnt a scam, its a roleplaying service. I've seen this episode of Seinfeld Assuming that this isn't fake, go buy a can of bear mace and sit somewhere where you can see your car.  When you see someone messing with it, go over there and empty the can onto them. In what country do you live that hookers need a story to give you a blowjob ? Pretty sure this is the plot to a seinfeld episode... Rig up some sort of airhorn you can activate from a distance and when she brings a guy back let er rip! Why doesn't she just put the cap back on? That's for the F-Shack.  - Dirty Mike and the boys. Friend, do a sting on the hooker! Find him/her and play along with their scheme. Then when you're at "their" car, use your key fab and hook it at them.

*edited Dude to Friend... because gender. Are we sure this isn't a viral ad campaign for that new R. Kelly album, "Hookers be scammin"?
 Is she your bottom bitch? I think it's an invitation to a second job OP. where is the napkin from? thats all i want to know Oh my god! This is AWFUL! Where do you live exactly? Where is she doing this blowjobbing?! I wonder how many blow jobs this guy received before decided to leave a note. Someone might be using it as a [soup kitchen](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/3610537183/dirty-mike-and-the-boys-the-other-guys). Hidden camera time! It means you are doing your part and going green. More than I am You should get remote engine start. So when she flags people down and gets them near the car, you press the button and the car starts.  Damnit, I live too far from the action to rent my vehicle, and I'm too old and male to be a gas scam hooker. Is that a Subway napkin?  It might be Jared writing these notes if so. Leave a note on top of the gas cap " Put the cover back and walk away. Don't let me catch you doing this again" It means your car is being used by hookers to scam.. If you come outside in the middle of the night and there is a guy sticking his dick in the gas flap of your Jeep, demand payment immediately. It's too bad that was written on the backside of that napkin... It's a Starbucks napkin, &amp; I feel that had the logo been present, it would have made it even better.  Handwriting of the note appears to be feminine. There's only one way to get to the bottom of this.  Look out for hookers who claim they are out of gas, and offer to help and see if they lead you to your car. Thing or someone is getting screwed Is that a Chipotle napkin? set up a hidden cam I've been looking for a way to make money and keep my jeep...  Jeepin as explained by 1995's classic, Clueless-  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAhl6Mce_k I would clean those seats. Or possibly get a hard top and doors. Gross -Love, Dirty Mike and the boys I initially misread "car" as "cat" and was very worried. Go outside at night and find out. I have the answer Master_yourself:
Get a hard top for your CJ, YJ, TJ, JK what ever.

 Maybe your car is being used as a "Soup Kitchen" How do you know your jeep isn't the hooker? Set up a little camera and see how its done. Next, recruit your flock. Then, turn 'em out. PS You need like... 7 more jeeps. Yes, this means that you live in at least a somewhat shady neighborhood.   Time to get a locking gas cap. chipotle napkin  I live in a shady complex in Tampa. I have a Jeep. I hope this is whats happening when Im not around. Your Jeep must feel Cheap and used, at least she could of topped off the tank.... Sounds like someone's fucking your gas tank  Get her to proposition you, then drive to the police station once you're both inside the Jeep Does your jeep have doors and a roof on it? Because if not  I'd say its UV light time. God knows what you've been sitting in this whole time.  My mind is immediately drawn to the Seinfeld episode where hookers are using George's car to turn trick in. This was also my yearbook quote. your gas cap now has STDs congrats! This is bullshit. 86,381 trees my ass. Did they count how many trees it took for all the trucks, the land, the government employees and private contractors, the facility to recycle this napkin, etc...?

How many trees did it cost for them to make up this bullshit number? The police are using it to catch a hooker?
 Sounds like opportunity knocking there.  You've some interesting options available to you. Be sure they didn't leave a deer vagina in the back seat with a note from Dirty Mike and the boys! Nice try,  Costanza! They're trying to tell you that you need a locking gas cap. Install a hidden camera! You sir could have your own reality vd series, if that doesn't work you could fall back on extortion. Then claim a failed business take a load of write offs and go on unemployment for two years. I means you should probably clean your seats. recycle? Prob unzips the top gets in and makes like it was her car Gives new meaning to 'pimp my ride'. LOL, I thought the 'gashole' (as I call it) was being used in some kinky way to make money. Fit it with hidden camera. Say nothing to police, post results.

OP will surely deliver. By Dirty Mike and The Boys Long as she fills up your tank end if the night. 

Psst put a snake under the back seat ;) i would guess. that a hooker is standing near it,, with the gas cap off, pretending she's out of gas., and when people come to help her, she offers her services I can't wait for the thread where you find out your neighbors are redditors.   


Dear Reddit I was out being Good Guy Greg and a woman ran out of gas in her jeep.  I helped her out and she blew me like every Good Girl Gina meme... Success kid.    

Then someone links then here for the SAP. I think it is literal. Someone had sex with your car. what if this was left by a guy who gave her money in exchange for a bj and she ran away.  Get a Go Pro. Seriously, awesome fucking camera, not just for catching people fucking with your shit. its nice this person cares about the Earth. Recycle! Hookers! this napken has "it"
this napken has it all. "Can you bring me back to my car? I need you to fill my tank" *wink* Well you lucky bastard. A hooker using your jeep for a scam. People only siphoned gas from my jeep. The second time, they didn't even put the cap back on. This means they kept it, because I didn't find it.  I believe it means that since it is made with 100% recycled paper, you should recycle it as well.  Do a good deed man. What if it's a male hooker making woopie into your gas tank. I honestly think it means someone is screwing the gas hole. That's a Chipotle napkin. If she ate the hotsauce, you might be in for a big suprise... Someone is pimping your ride for real. JiffyPark? My guess would be the scam goes like this.

Hooker gets a john out by the road somewhere. Says pay me and ill meet you at the jeep whatever in back. Its grey and dont have a gas cap on it. Dude pays and drives back to your jeep only to find out shes not coming. If its a scam i have to assume no ones getting any from her. Sincerely,

A guy who just got blown for $13, a thing of WD-40, and a can of mixed lawnmower gas. Pimpin ain't easy you put a note on the car that says:

"how can I get in on that?" George Costanza had a similar problem I think they're doing exactly what they say... trying to keep your chin clean. Jersey Mike and the boys? Looks like I am going into the pimping businesses.  Off to go get me a gold chain!!! Hooker as in tow truck, or as in T.J.?
 yeah, but did you recycle the napkin? You better get up on that hustle! Go get your cut! Get a hidden dashboard cam and find out for yourself (And post the results, of course). Setup a IP cam and post the link here. Sounds like your Jeep is a PATRIOT. *salutes* IDK but I'm thinkin you could totally get a free BJ out of it. My guess is she is using your vehicle as the meet up spot for some promiscuous acts, and removing the cap to make sure the clients know which vehicle to meet at. She meets them in the day, says "i'll be in this location, meet me by the jeep in the back with the gas cover open and the cap unscrewed" and then they do their business from their. Maybe your neighbor who doesn't actually know you saw this type of operation happen a few times and left this note for you so you can be informed. Buy a GoPro or small video camera. You know the rest. Sounds like the work of dirty mike and the boys Dirty Mike and the boys? I really like the different ligatures of the letter G.  get your jeep tested  Dirty Mike and the Boys found your car.  Dirty Mike and the boys visited  "Sincerely,

Disgruntled John" I just figured someone was pimping out your jeep for some sweet fuel-filler-neck fucky-fucky.

TIL: OP now has jizz in his gas tank. the amount of dirty mike and the boyz comments is very gratifying to see. Set up a [trail cam](http://www.cabelas.com/product/Stealth-Cam-Delta-8-Trail-Camera/1206049.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&amp;searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch.cmd%3Fform_state%3DsearchForm%26N%3D0%26fsch%3Dtrue%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Dtrail%2Bcam%26x%3D0%26y%3D0%26WTz_l%3DHeader%253BSearch-All%2BProducts&amp;Ntt=trail+cam&amp;WTz_l=Header%3BSearch-All+Products) to monitor your Jeep at night.  

Post pics in the morning. I recommend sanitizing the interior of your vehicle sir, you DO NOT want to be implicated in a crime, also wash the exterior while you're at it. I assume you don't have a hard/soft shell cover for it? Just wondering, but based on what everybody else said, have you noticed that your gas mileage seems to be better lately? Is that on a chipotle napkin? I think someone might be pimping your car and plowing it right in the gashole filling it up with bio fuel.   Dirty Mike and the Boys probably r/dragonsfuckingcars Try delivering the note to the cops and ask them.  They will know. You dont by any chance have a group of homosexual hobos calling themselves dirty mike and the boys in your area do you?  If you do i would take it somewhere to get cleaned. Your hooker goes to Starbucks Wait... So are they gassing up the Jeep for free? Let the good time roll! Crack....that's what it means  Dirty mike n the boys. I guess it could be true, but it seems crazy that absolutely everyone in here is taking this napkin note at face value.  To me none of the "hooker scams" people are theorizing about seem more plausible than the idea that the note-leaver is mistaken or lying.  The cap could also have been opened by that person, maybe looking around for evidence to confirm what they saw.

A person susceptible to paranoid delusions would be likely to interpret all kinds of things they saw happen around the car in this type of way, and I think it's also common behavior to want to warn others about their delusions by passing notes etc.  To me, "Your car is being used for a hooker scam.  Be aware It's being used at night." in that handwriting looks typical of schizophrenic language use.  I can definitely think of less dramatic and more informative ways of putting that, and if I were actually trying to help someone out, I could probably spare a real sheet of paper with room for more detail.

This would definitely stop me from putting up any "Hey hookers! I'm on to you!" signs.  It could be something else entirely and I wouldn't want to look like I'm the one jumping to paranoid conclusions. Dirty mike and the boys? Leave a note on your car saying "WTF OP - explain or GTFO".

Post back after OP - don't be a fag :) * The note is written on a Starbucks napkin.
* They must be wealthy enough to afford $5 coffees.
* Note was left by a John after bad experience!!??! I smell a stake out coming on... :) Cant wait for you to stake it out and report back, remember pics are worth 1000 words... Sounds like you need to stake out your jeep and figure it out... 

Stand and deliver OP.... pictures and video would work best.  At least they recycled that napkin. can u stake out ur own car tonight and take pics? It means that dirty mike and the boys have been there,  and they will be back...  Recycle the note, as it says.
Leave it on someone else's car. Dirty Mike and the Boys at it again Signed: Dirty Mike and the Boys. She is fucking people in/on you jeep. Sniff the seats and enjoy. At she's a environment-safe hooker, recycling paper and whatnot.  I think it means you should start hiding in the bushes with a shotgun at night for a while Dirty mike and the boys are at it again Hm..I have no clue but definitely notify the police and keep us posted OP.  Dirty Mike and the Boys strike again I think it means its time to move. Lol Dirty Mike and the Boys

Posting because I'm a dumb idiot :D Better than "Thanks for the fuck shack. - Dirty Mike and the Boys" Everyone chillax. This is just some homeless schizophrenic writing nonsense that they believe is true. I had gas siphoned from my car once. Saw the open cap and noticed I had less than a 1/2 tank. I had filled up a day prior. Some vet said he saw a van with the side door open and when he came down his steps the peeled away. Hookers make for a much better story though. 
 That is girl hand writing. Most likely the hooker's competition. They're f##king the jeep through the the gas tank...and someone's getting paid for it. Sounds like your car is being advertised as a glory hole and someone with a dick that smells faintly of gasoline left a note on the windshield.  ITT: So many reasons I'm glad I have a garage. there is a hooker inside your gas tank sir whatever happens, just make sure...be very sure...that that napkin is recycled Dunkin donuts napkin Starbucks napkin, if that is any indication?

Regardless, this is really strange. they mean you should sell your car for one with locks and an alarm A neighbour or someone that saw a hooker siphoning gas from your car, left a note? At first I thought the note was written in tiny text upside down because the picture loaded so slowly... Actually sounds like someone has tried fucking your jeep.

In the note is says "used for a hooker" and that your gas tank is open... Well guess you're going to find out if the secret additive in the fuel helps or not... Dash cam! At least it wasn't Dirty Mike and his boys this time. Maybe a guy is having sex with your gas tank  I think its self explanatory Well, time to park the car in the garage... Reminds me of the type of those notes that schizophrenic people leave. Thanks for the F-shack.

    - Dirty Mike and the Boys

 Watch the Seinfeld episode concerning this for all the information you need. Have any of your lemons gone missing? My guess is by being "used" they mean [soup kitchen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1j4mK6cs_A) Thanks for the f shack.  Love dirty mike and the boys My guess is your car is getting more action than you are. Ha...or me  :( shit. Maybe a neighbor saw something going on and they put the note so you would know about it  I'm carrying $20's from now on.  dash cam. You should recycle your napkin.  Duh. They call that a soup kitchen. Clearly someone was jealous of us Jeep drivers (well, you especially). Big jim and the boys That the napkin can be recycled my first thought is "not the jeep!!! no!!! " I  have to urge to leave weird notes like this at local apartment complexes then wait to read about them on reddit. Whatever goes down, we need updates OP! Sounds less like a hooker scam, and more like just being used by a hooker Is that a napkin from Chipotle? Over 10 years ago I was parked right outside of downtown in a major southeastern outside a small concert venue waiting on a girl I was dating to show up.  An older woman 40-50 and white approached my car and talked about how her car ran out of gas on the interstate and I shouldn't be parked out here in this sort of neighborhood(not far from the ghetto but not really a bad area), and how god blesses people who do good deeds and whatnot.  She was just normal looking enough where I didn't think she was a crackhead and I guess I believed her story or at least didn't want to call her out on it.

I just ended up taking her to a gas station not far away in the actual rough part of town and took 10 dollars out of the atm and gave it to her and went back to the place I was waiting.  The whole thing was a little strange and I still wonder what was actually going on with it.
 It means your wife is a hooker. it means park your car in the garage You need to get it detailed... pay extra for the top service. unless it's a fetish and people are "doing" your jeep via the ol' gas hole do you leave the top off? Time for a new car That is a starbucks napkin.  That's fucking creepy. You might want to file a police report.  its called a soup kitchen It means put the car in some kind of garage. Install Cameras, get back to us your jeep now has herpes. congrats. Intriguing....a hooker scam eh? Any blackjack going on? [deleted] Its dirty mike and the boys Dirty Mike and the Boys strike again! probably been said already.


Seinfeld has your answer:

http://youtu.be/NqUHRgleRk0

 Sounds like Dirty Mike and the Boys struck again. Thanks for the F Shack - dirty Mike and the boys Love, Dirty Mike and the boys  Thanks for the fuck shack, dirty Mike and the boys Are you dirty mike and the boys? Well, I think someone fucked your jeep. Watch out bro, she's lost her virginity to another man. The hooker is taking gas from you to hold onto and resell later when the price goes up, so she can buy more hooker things like condoms with pre made holes in them. Step 1: Write message on napkin
Step 2: Karma

Reddit cmon guys... Do you leave your car doors unlocked? Signed: dirty Mike and the boys  Simple solution... lock your fucking car.  Dirty Mike and the Boys. Benny stopped for a breather near the old coalmines, slipping into one of the coal bins and out of sight.

He had been running for nearly 6 hours on and off. Benny *hated* having his picture taken, but Chuck the yearbook club president was a stubborn little fool. 

Suddenly--"Benny! Benny! One for the yearbook! Gimme a smile!"

Sadly, Benny didn't smile, and the rest is history. [This is a picture](http://www.colorcombos.com/images/colors/FFFFFF.png) of a Klu Klux Klansman being gang-raped by a pack of polar bears in a snowstorm. That's some pretty dark humor. [It looks like a Rothko painting.](http://www.thewatchfulear.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/mark_rothko_untitled_no41964.jpg) Should've said "cheese". This is a picture of a dark time in our history. Why was he in a coal bin so late at night? I only thought of how much toner they wasted printing this.  Fuck I have to quit my job Scary how normal this was looking at the thumbnail, i thought this was gonna be a post about Myst What year was the yearbook from? don't leave your finger on that page as a bookmark if your gonna close it. Whatever is waiting in that dark void will grab you and try to pull you in...or just eat your finger. Wow, a Tom Coffee original! [deleted] [deleted] Just googled coal bin. I think I may have found the men behind this. 
http://i.imgur.com/VomkMgE.jpg That's awesome There's a Dark Night Rises joke in here but I am not a clever enough man to make it. 

 Looks like the NSA redacted that page! You didn't even know it was in your ear?

Let me go grab some qtips... How did you not feel that? Or feel the deadening of the sound on that side?
or?

or?? ARRGH Did it bug you much? Box elder bugs.  The newest ASMR fad. Mod from /r/whatsthisbug here - it is something in the order Hemiptera but without a dorsal shot we will have a tough time ID-ing it. Do you still have it? If you can get a picture straight down on it we can help you figure out what it is.  KHAAAAANNNNN! OK, great so now I have to add - stuff cotton wool into ears - into my bedtime routine.  What did you name it? Is that a Box Elder Bug?? Those little bastards torment us every year and no one ever knows what they are unless you live within a few feet of one of those damn trees. Fuckers. this was almost the last thing i looked at before sleeping. now i have to watch disney for an hour, and put cotton in my ears from now until forever.  So. Okay. Earmuffs when I sleep? Check.  Dear god how did you not notice it before hand. Were you a prisoner in Thailand? Because that's what happened in Brokedown Palace   [Better that than this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EPPnxwKuFM) Anders? oh my damn.... 
 Dead. How in the name if Jesus did you walk around with a bug in your ear and NOT notice! At first it was alive obviously or it couldn't have crawled in there. Lives there without you even noticing your hearing was blocked by a ginormous bug?? Also, do you bathe or shower? The bug would have probably floated out during soap or shampooing.  Seriously that's the only thing remotely wtf!  Nooooo! You should make friends with the eraser ear guy. [NOPE](http://i.imgur.com/xBagizD.gif) So did you drank a lot of waters in the past weeks? And in a few weeks the eggs will hatch and little ones of that bugger will be crawling all up in your brain and ear canal.  If you start hearing popping and crackling.  That's the eggs hatching.  My friend had a bug fly into her ear, stayed there for 2+ days. The ER had to get it out. I AM SO SCARED OF THE OUTDOORS NOW. A couple of days ago, I fell asleep listening to music. I woke up at like 3 in the morning to take a leak and one of my earphone buds was deep inside my ear. I had to use my girlfriend's tweezers to get it out. It hurt like a bitch.  http://cdn.arwrath.com/1/115242.gif Fucking fuck Oh yum. I'm surprised it wasn't *bugging* you before you went to the doctor.  You're an idiot if you didn't know. my first question would be...why? impressive shit Wow so many feces related puns and not one comment actually  funny or telling the background story of why someone would make this piece of shit.  When that thaws........ &gt;made entirely of cow dung.

i like the *cow-dung* yellow eyes


 Put your tongue on it.  The [spirit](http://photos.igougo.com/photos/journal/pref/serpent83g_prefRes.jpg) of San Jose.  What a shitty sculpture Entirely? How'd they make the eyes? o.o A poothon! Cool idea, but the craftsmanship looks a bit shitty. I didn't think "What the fuck" I thought WHY the fuck? Whoa. Must have been a big cow. Impressively disgusting. [COBRA!!!!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxQa8VL8bUg) Nice brownsnake. I don't know what I expected. The bite comes when it thaws out. And they say you can't polish a turd. Wow, aint that some shit. i would like to know

if the artist wore a mask

it must smell like shit Cowadunga! [MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pile_of_shit.gif) only humans. and that's why, we have to stop global warming. Should be titled "Yet ANOTHER giant frozen cobra statue made entirely of cow dung." Doesn't that piggy stay at home?  It's all about interpretation.  This is her admiring her work, not a statue. 2 questions.

1. is it hand made?

2. Who's hands made it?

I would prefer to steer clear of that particular artist...
I'd hate to have to pull a [Mr. Lippmann](http://seinfeld.wikia.com/wiki/The_Opposite) and leave my handkerchief somewhere.... Here take a picture with my shit snake -_- Why? I imagine this is what a bathroom looks like after the Tunnel Snakes use it. Not a fan of the sculptor, he does really shitty work. All your shit belong to me!!! Thought it was going to be [this one](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;docid=cnLKY1i-cnST2M&amp;tbnid=-0LkAV23RRQG4M:&amp;ved=0CAUQjRw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sanjoseinside.com%2Fnews%2Fentries%2F04_25_11_water_pollution_control_plant%2F&amp;ei=vHpUUrDhH4eGswb1u4GABQ&amp;psig=AFQjCNEFF96ugctdceL0dRnVU6LxQbc5KA&amp;ust=1381354549972631) "Dammit, Tuaq got into the refried beans again!" Primo coil-up. Now whenever I see a coiled up snake my mind will immediately think "poo poo".  Well played. mmmmmmm fudgesicle  Well I don't know what I was expecting.... That must've been one huge cow! I can already tell what it was before they made the cobra head and tail....  Well, that's just shit Where did the fluorescent orange shit come from? http://i.imgur.com/NWMB4mG.gif Well everyone needs a hobby.  2 questions: Who found all this shit and who sculpted this shit. No three questions...why use SHIT? Not sure whether to "EWWWWWWW" or "AAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHH." Well now I've seen it all. http://i.imgur.com/dXobx.gif That is the biggest pile of shit I have ever seen in my life  Take it [Ian](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pile_of_shit.gif) It's either a comment on the state of modern art OR an artistic criticism of the failure of socialism in the provision of art supplies.

 Ah thats nothing. Gimme 5 big macs and i can shit an anaconda. Wat this sculpture is shitty I can smell it from here Obligatory "It looks like shit." Someone was stoned off their ass. Well shit. What a pile of shit  I had to click on it. I had to know.  That is one big pile of shit. I feel like the artist was originally going for "giant twisty poo" and at the last second was like.. "No no, SNAKE."  Look at all the shitty one-liners. Looks almost hand rolled Looks disturbingly similar to a statue of Quetzelcoatl sitting right in the middle of downtown San Jose.  Why? That must have been one shitty project to work on.  Poor bastard. This reminds me of the shit knife. 

In north Canada the Mounties are patriating Natives to a reservation of some kind. Old man doesn't want to go and slips out in the night. He shits into his hand, forms a blade using the feces and his saliva and kills a dog to make it into a dog sled so he can disappear into the night.

I always thought this was a William Burroughs type long tale. Turns out there is anthropological data to back it up:

http://boingboing.net/2008/09/26/wade-davis-an-inuit.html They don't call it brown snake for nothin Misleading Title. The eyes man, the eyes. At least they got the coil right. Shit shit shit shit

Can I get upvotes now? Damn, I just really want that girl's amazing coat!
 Thats the shit! That's the name of my new rock band...Frozen Cobra. yo.... that thing you left in the can after you ate all that fiber crap.... i moved it to the yard...  How funny. I consider this more art than half the crap at any of scoitiabanks nuite blanche events. They truly suck. So does scotia. Wow who in the fucking shit does that! Some people have entirely too much time on their hands Obvious ripoff of the world famous [San Jose Turd](https://www.google.com/search?q=san+jose+turd&amp;tbm=isch) the coils look like a giant turd Repost seen this three times in the past 6 months That's enough reddit for tonight. Well, ain't that some shit! fucking mongolians Someone was elbow deep in cow shit for several hours. It's a cow paddy cobra!  At least it doesn't smell. That statue's a piece of shit. Made entirely of too much time on their hands. Truly, it is magnificent.  That's one shitty snake.  This made me think of the Poo Snake from Blue Dragon.

http://bluedragon.wikia.com/wiki/Poo_Snake Must of had a lot of shit on their hands making it  This actually made me think, "what the fuck," a thought I have too infrequently when on /r/wtf. SHIT!  A SNAAAYKE! Despite the "frozen", my first thought was still "India" Did the cows died?  Holy shit!  "An artist?"

"Yes."

"What's your medium?"

"I work exclusively in cow dung." It stinks! Calgary city council pays big money for crappy art not made out of shit. WTF, is a "Frozen Cobra" Those must be at least 230 Courics.  That's one shitty statue. I call bullshit Bullshit. God im so bored today...what to do.  Oh look at that cow taking a dump.  Lets make a giant cobra statue!

Drugs are bad, mk? Who comes up with such shit?  Badger, Badger, Badger - Bathroom, Bathroom... Very Talented!!!

To me, it looks like he started moving to get behind cover before the rocket had left the tube, thereby turning it and causing it to go toward the nearby building rather than down the street/alleyway.

Feel free to send me a message if I might be able to assist. Did this to myself in Duke Nukem way too many times... He isn't dead. Look closely at the end, you can see him running towards his buddies. fucking stupid gifs that end before you see what happens...where's the video At least his back blast was clear. Rocket jump fail. Did he really shoot a bazooka/RPG at a wall 5 feet in front?... I wish this was 2-3 seconds longer, so I keep watching it and hoping I will be able to see a little more but so far it's not working. Did anyone notice the guy standing on the other corner fly back from the explosion?
He definitely died, but it seems everyone is focused on the one who launched it. I circled him, but It could just be debris. http://imgur.com/a/5zU5b

Seen better in [here](http://gif-explode.com/?explode=http://i.imgur.com/Drlo4Tb.gif) courtesy of /u/Kelden21 He just didn't like where he spawned  Shoes didn't come off, confirmed survived. Don't rpgs need to travel a certain distance for them to be armed? Or it it just a lower tech rpg? I pulled the GIF apart, and he is running towards the guys in the background before the smoke and dust covers the frame.

Here you can see him in the right portion with his back towards the camera and the RPG on his shoulder.

http://imgur.com/FrcqEk5 You can hear his buddy laughing at him at the end. He tried to run before the rocket went off. http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=44d_1211647625 There is a liveleak video that shows a guy firing an improperly maintained RPG and ends up exploding himself all over the place. At first they are all, "Fuck yeah, we're so cool. Let's kill some westerners." Then they're all, "Noooo broooo!!"

Most hilarious gore I've ever seen. I thought this only happened in video games! it looks like nothing happened to him if you focus on him you see him turn and run Teamkillers: it's always the guy with the rocket launcher. Always... I did this too. In DOOM.  Does he blend? Yes he does How do people that dumb get access to weapons that powerful? Nice backflip. He was just trying to launch himself up to the roof on 2Fort FATALITY He should ask for a RMA It looks like he thinks that it has shot, and moves the aim towards the wall that he covers behind. And then it fires. Yeah I do this in battlefield  Team Killing is frowned upon. The Tech department calls this the ID10T error. User error ID ten T Luckily he had the silencer on. Oh That looks like me playing call of duty.  [Must be an Asshole.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNJj-PA8lKU) Fucking noob tube. Why would you shoot it so close! Your insane! It's actually created to not detonate that soon even if it hits something  Hi, I'm Johnny Muhammad, and this is Arabian Jackass I'm pretty sure he got blown to bits. This is what we've been fighting for the past 12 years? It almost looks like we're missing frames in the middle or something, or the video is like 10 fps.  This should be titled "Fuck Yo Store" That's not his RPG that causes the explosion, that's whatever that he was firing at firing back.  allah akbar is the new yolo that's what quake world with 70 ping feels like That's not how you rocket jump fucking lag, i shot the rocket before i moved behind cover! I thought he was trying to rocket jump... He didn't RTFM.  And that was the last time we let bobby use the rocket launcher I've done this so many times in Halo is he dead I can hear this gif You had one job guy... I think once something has been on Tosh, that it shouldn't be allowed on Reddit. How big of a repost can you get?  I think that was his pants in midair  I've been watching this like it's some crazy dubstep drop for too long.. You're doing it WRONG! fucking auto-aim Could you put a warning death sign up? omg lag looks like friendly fire was on failure to follow through There is no excuse for this error.  The instructions are clearly printed on the side of the weapon. You can definitely see the two men next to the building flying opposite of the impact from the RPG. You can notice the white shirt of the one and all dark clothing of the other.  But, did his shoes come off? He should have done a rocket jump. An ID-10-T  error. Reminds me of noobs picking up the rocket launcher in Halo SHOT WIDE!

I shouldn't have, but I laughed; I'm sorry, I could not help it, it caught me off guard and I laughed my ass off. I know, I know, goin to hell, yadda yadda, but fuck it. Because the RPG wouldn't be armed at this distance(most likely) I would *guess* the explosion is shear force and possibly whatever is in the building reacting to being hit and not the actual explosive portion. Rocket Propelled Rock. Are... are those heads at the end? "Hey, Ahkmed, may peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be upon you, but that is a rocket, not a garage door opener!" give monkeys bazookas and you get this. This video is from Iraq -Al Sadr city ,this dumbass was attacking the US Army. Damn it Jamal! you had one job! He has all three types of retardation  The munition wouldn't arm at that distance. He is being shot at by someone and the explosion is from his enemy. So umm was that him flying in pieces or the wall? I love how everyone is calling the guy stupid.

Let's see how you pinheads do when war comes home to you and you have to take up arms or roll over and play dead. I doubt most of you would be able to point the right end of an RPG at your target, let alone hit it. LOL! You gotta love the comedy that the 3rd world provides Ok step point directly at wall , step to touch the wall with the rocket ,step three pull the trigger This isn't wtf... A shell script.

I think this should have a death tag Allah Akbar! Lmao At this point, after watching so many of these videos, I wouldn't even be worried if an Arab/African pointed an RPG at me. Well, unless I cared for the person with the bazooka, seeing how they usually blow up themselves or some object that belongs to them. What morons. Not to be that guy but nsfw and nsfl tag please?

Reminds me of Lucy, Daughter of the Devil. Very sad for the cattle and the rancher North Dakotan here.

A lot of the dead cattle has to do with how the snow began. Lots of very cold rain preceded all the snow fall, and while temperatures dropped and they were basically frozen from all the rain, then it started to dump feet of snow on them, they tried huddling together but still couldn't make it warm enough to stay alive. [Album with more pictures] (http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1o0nfh/album_of_the_cattle_killed_from_the_snowstorm_in/) all credit should go to [BigBallsInCowtown.com](http://bigballsincowtown.com/storm2013.htm).

 What is the procedure for this?  Burn them all where they lie?  Dig a pit and bury them?  Also, what if you were walking around in a field and fell through the wet grass into a shallow grave filled with partially decomposed cattle?  I think you'd barf and die. News article http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/early-snow-leaves-thousands-power-sd-20497588 talks a bit about number of dead cattle. Bury them.  Then buy the mineral rights for the land.  Wait a few million years, profit! Poor little cows :( like the jonestown moosacre Would buffalo be less likely to succumb this way? They're just taking a bath right?^...right?


^^guys? Off to Golden Corral they go. damn, that is rather sad.. Oh good, the frozen beef soup is thawing out. Damn.
 It sucks that this is very sad but yet we eat them like they're nothing. Often in a driving blizzard cattle will gather in a low ravine somewhat out of the wind and in heavy snow conditions such as this will be buried alive with snow and die of suffocation. Seen it happen in a blizzard in Kansas a few years ago. Looks like meats back on the menu, boys! where abouts in the black hills? Nice to see some south dakota redditors i didn't think it was cold enough to kill them.  Probably smells lovely. So they went swimming? Hmm, looks like an opportunity [Hāngi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C4%81ngi) waiting to happen. sea cows..? Imagine the stench...  Poor things. What is where dog food comes from? Wow, I knew our storm was bad but I didnt even think of what would happen to all the livestock. I did see alot of cattle running around because the snow was so high they just walked over the fences Damn, Mother Nature, you suck.  Is it in bad taste to make a ground beef joke? I'm from South Dakota in the black hills and I just got out of 3 days of now power and food. Driving around near my house there's loads of dead cattle and deer and it just makes me sad. Leather and dog food. They might cover cost. Poor little cows. Death by exposure is a rough one. Being a fellow South Dakotan, I can honestly say we have the strangest weather. While you guys in the western half of the state were getting 40+ inches of snow, we (eastern part of state) were getting tornadoes and thunderstorms all at about the same time. This is actually pretty heartbreaking.  Poor cows.  :-(  Then again, I eat them.  I'm conflicted. I live in Rapid City, I can assure you this was a shit storm of crazy proportions. My school (SDSMT) JUST reopened today. I walked around campus and there were trees down and broken limbs EVERYWHERE.  I live down town so there werent many other things i could see between there and school, beyond buildings. Most of the major roads in town were one lane until mid day Monday. Pretty intense. Glad I moved from the Black Hills. I live in the blackhills. We knew the storm was coming on the 30th. The storm hit the 4th. I don't know that it was a matter of not having time to round up cattle, but rather not having the room to house all of them. Having a barn large enough to house 200 head of cattle is rather unheard of around here.  I feel bad for the Rancher, but cows are fucking retarded and they were going to die anyway. So they got snowed on and died? Quick question for those cattle farmers on here, do you guys carry insurance for things like this? I assume it exists, but is it common to carry it or is it something that smaller farmers simply can't afford very often? And meanwhile in neighboring state, Minnesota, it's 75 and sunny... I will never understand the Midwestern weather. I've decided to cry :( too bad they didnt have warm, leather coats So are they all okay?! Come on.....  I always think that livestock need shelter. just to cover them from the rain or get them in the shade. Like a 1000 cows for one tree. Not cool. Was it cold or something? HOLY CRAP I thought they were rocks until i zoomed in D: some big missed steaks were made here... What a waste of perfectly good cheeseburgers. This is awful!  


WHERE IS THE GRILL!!!! So much good meat gone to waste.  I bet it smells delicious over there Quick you can still use the meat for bk My god, the smell of that must be unreal. BEST. POOL PARTY. EVER. God's beef soup That's making me hungry Isn't that animal cruelty? they were shot to death.. in case anyone was wondering  South Dakotan here. 

Fuck those people in the hills anyways, they're jerks. woah fuckin dead animals you know cause that's pretty fuckin horrifying. I also masturbate to softcore porn and drink five energy to wake myself up cause im intense Bullshit Sounds like lazy ranchers wanting to cash in on insurance. They knew the storm was coming. No reason they couldn't go out and round em up and get them to shelter. All that beef will be on your dinner plate sometime next week.  Just stick car in a bag of rice, it will be as good as new.  Am I missing something?  Isn't this what flooded streets look like? these cars will be for sale in russia in a 4 days I've never seen the carpool lane so crowded. where in shanghai is this? because I live right in french concession and all we got was moderate rain.  Last time I was in Shanghai, a skyscraper collapsed and I was forced to parachute to safety.

Edit after upvote: When a team focuses on C and loses the rest of the objectives, I call it an Ivory Tower scenario. I'm hoping that catches on. I actually do live in Shanghai and I didn't see that level of flooding anywhere. Not in local journals, website etc.. I'm calling bullshit. 

Yes it's been pouring rain for 3 days now but it's not that bad. 
 WTF, A FLOOD? Damn, that Levolution looks intense! How the hell are you supposed to solve this level of Rush Hour if the red car is on a diagonal direction ?  I live in Shanghai and it certainly does not look like this. We did have a thunderstorm and a subsequent flash flood about three weeks ago so this picture could have been from then but certainly not these past couple days.  We had puddles today and that is all. &gt; My mate lives in Venice...

But seriously, wtf Stepping Stones Dice's levolution is leaking out of the beta. finally, some order to the streets of Shanghai [Relevant] (http://appworld.easycgi.com/Assets/Content/BlackberryApps/Parking%20Lot.png) This was all I saw. Aaaaaand here's the link I posted yesterday that no one gave a shit about... http://i.imgur.com/YrE0pAf.jpg?1 Looks like the street is filled with boba tea. I was just in Shanghai a few weeks ago.  I think the city has a really poor drainage system in place.  It rained a regular rainfall one night and the city seemed half flooded.   Who the fuck dumped all those cars in Venice? [Reminded me of this.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xd5aEjCcjL4/TUdYckub2uI/AAAAAAAABb4/tY_N50kUI4A/s320/marshmallow+hot+cocoa.JPG) Kia Soup? It looks like someone failed a game of Tetris. Everyone laughed at the guy with the monster truck. I like that guy standing there on the balcony. You can just hear him saying ".....fuck."  
  
Or ".....我靠." as the case may be. Not sure if a car wash or a car pool I'm in Thailand at the moment and decided to cancel my trip through Cambodia because of their flooding. I'm not sure what kind of coverage it's getting in the states but it's claimed a lot of lives and some are still missing. Having said that I have to fly through Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong and Tokyo within the next week and they're all experiencing some sort of flooding/typhoon related problem. I couldn't have picked a worst flight path back home. However if along the way I can help out in any way with relief I will at the drop of a hat.  Its like tetris but with drowned people Well who would have thought a tropical storm system would bring rain and storm surge? What the fuck?

Full disclaimer: I'm from the south US, so I'm pretty used to hurricanes, but I figured that it was pretty common knowledge that these things bring tons of water.  OP is a lying piece of shit he probably just got this picture from one his mates who lives in china who took it straight from the news  This is not wtf. Now, Manila 3 years ago was wtf, thanks to Ondoy. Almost 24 hours of nonstop rain, chunks of Metro Manila and nearby provinces underwater, and a ton of casualties. THE FLOOR IS LAVA! this reminds me of being little and playing with my hotwheels in this little muddy river I had in my side yard. I would squish them into the mud and it looked just liked this. Gods just doing the real life version of my childhood games. yes i played in am muddy river shut up  This is not wtf [More pictures of the flood](http://imgur.com/a/OFJ2q)

edit: turns out they weren't taken by my friends, sorry! Its like that every week in Cornwall and Devon.  I thought it was Hengsha, that's where I used my typhoon. Why do so many cars have moon roofs?  Are those cars now worthless? Can it fix? [deleted] free carwash! Is this by Fudan University? Car for sale. Brand new carpet too! Car soup! car soup anyone? Look a red car. Well that's what happens when you live in up-sea.  It's almost as if water performed a siege... of Shanghai. Damn, up in S Korea we only had light rain today from the typhoon. We were supposed to get dumped on all day. Did most of these cars get carried by the water? If not, what the hell kind of parking system do they have going on here? It looks like a mud puddle full of water beetles.  Wellp I'm not getting to work today. mmm gravy flood Car soup. New game: pretend the water is lava whilst hopping from car to car It's a good thing those guys rolled their windows up. White car forward black car back white car up pickup truck back white car out. Its traffic jam people Battlefield 4 LEVELUTION in action My girlfriend can park better than that!   And I thought she was horrible!  Can someone explain to me like I'm 5; how does this much water accumulate in a city setting?  I go to school in Shanghai and it was flooded enough for class to be cancelled today so I guess it's not all bad Looks like a bizarro version of Frogger The sad thing is cars in Shanghai cost six times as much as in the USA. A Prius costs almost six-figures when converted to the USD. Its like the flood said, "Yeah, ima fill up just enough to fuck all of your first floors and cars, but not really anything else." mmm car soup. The great thing about coco pebbles What the.. I just got back home from shanghai last night, and there was no floods anywhere nor anything on the news ... Hongongk was hit though That's just morning rush hour. Nothing to see here. Welp, lucky I live in the Wuchaochong district. Its pretty bad here as well Kind of looks like a game of Blocks...
You've got to get the red car to the exit. Levolution. I knew I shouldn't have left my windows down. Here is a pic of a public bus completely under water http://img1.gtimg.com/7/763/76350/7635066_1200x1000_0.jpg

The drainage systems in china are terrible and a bad rain storm will cause massive flooding. Last year in beijing the same thing happend at it was only a regular rain storm that lasted for more than 24 hours and it flooded the city Did this happen today? My meeting might be cancelled if so...and then I can sleep good thing all of the parts for those cars are made close by Looks like [Unblock my Car.](http://i.imgur.com/h4jPXCp.jpg) First thought when I saw this: Man, I hope they have flood insurance!
Second thought: Damn that's gotta suck I hope your friend is alright!  Mmmmm street cereal And here we see a herd of sedans bathing in a local watering hole. Good time to buy insurance shares. So for snow, salt is the answer. For typhoons... It must be rice!! Load up em trucks, boys! We're gonna rice the streets.  How do entire communities recover from disasters like this? I'm assuming all those cars won't be running, all the flooring and drywall would be ruined on the first floor, the loss of belongings would be tremendous.. It's sad to think about  Amazing work ethic on display here. Everyone pulling their cars out ready for the morning commute lots of Japanese and German cars with the occasional 'murican and french thrown in for good measure. I love Shanghai, beautiful city.  There's a lot of the white cars with Sun roofs Nature is the worst Tetris player ever.  What?!? I live in Shanghai too. Must be a different area because it's not flooded where I am. Where and when is this? Oddly the most interesting part of the photo for me was that these appear to be actual historic buildings... in China? I thought they'd bulldozed everything for freeways. :-) That water must be disGUSting Is it odd that my first thought in this pic was that the water looked like soup? With around 40 odd cars there the insurance claims will be well into the 5 or 6 figure range, put together.  Probably not a good day for Insurance companies. Note to self... rent a space on the 3rd level of a local car park if living in Shanghai. Is there US-style motor vehicle insurance in China?  This reminds me of that childhood game where if you touch the floor you lose because it's Lava. Looks kind of fun just trying to stay dry hoping from car to car. Levolution Huh. Sick.  Never experienced it to this degree before. I used to live there for almost 5 years during my teens. You're all set for a massive game of The Floor Is Lava! That water is very dangerous. It is seething with e-coli, heavy metals, and, since it is in China, every pollutant known to man. Awesome. How to win Frogger which street? I can't believe the typhoon created so much jpeg! I'd hate to be the guy who left his window open I hope I remembered to roll up my windows. Puzzle solved... i can get the the red car out ;) The red car is just designed to create an illusion of a repeating program.

 http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/4472175/matrix-woman-in-red-o.gif i hope they have geico 
 Thank god theres a zipline. What why xian? Soooo, \R\Calgary back in June? Looks like someone's in need of a *gravy boat.* I can't help but notice the black SUV in the bottom right. It looks like it's floating on it's tires or something. Wow. It blasted almost every car black or white. How'd that red one escape? I feel sorry for these guys. I can't imagine that owning a car in China is any cheaper than over here. I bet their insurance company will still take half a year to pay out. Why PIC rike 1947 Imagine the sewers.  Thats right just keep building all those coal burning power plants and it'll be up to the third floor in no time... shit, there are some nice cars there too Can you imagine what that's gonna smell like in a few days? Blech.... I wonder if there is a kaernk in that water..those cars are begging to be hopped on  Bring down the skyscraper all the dust should soak that shit right up.

Oops, wrong subreddit. lol...wrong cheat code Where in Shanghai is this? Must be close to the river.  Do they discriminate against cars of color? That game of Tetris could have been much better. Looks like Shang wasn't that high after all. It's like the game Hot Lava just murky water instead This is why I live in California.  Dam now he gets to sit at home and play gta all day and I'm just sitting here. In the bathroom pretending I'm pooping. Levelution  The water is cleaner than normal. That must be nice.  Blur your eyes and it looks like a bunch of cell phones sitting on a table. r/jeep Would you like milk and cars in your coffee? Real life frogger? If you live on the bottom floor, congratulations, your apartment now has a swimming pool.  Well, at least the water looks safe to drink. There's a lot of black cars there Pulled this up on my tablet and at first glance thought it was a video game. o.O "Acts of God are not covered by your insurance policy with us.  Please remit your next payment by October 15th" Holy shit my MacBook just got shipped from Shanghai yesterday. I hope it's not lost haha. This is pretty ironic seeing how "Shanghai" literally means "above the sea." And here come the carpool jokes.. Am I the only person whose first thought was "why are they parked like that?" 

WTF indeed.  Levolution.  I find it both odd and somehow pleasing that I had a dream of my city's streets being totally flooded like this last night. I feel bad for the valet! I haven't played Frogger for AGES! Soup! Someone should take those toy cars out of the mud.

Oh... Typhoons cause JPEG compression artifacts? Anyone else wanna jump from car to car and see how far they can get without falling in the water? Shanghaitide Best place to play "Don't touch the floor" or whatever it's called in English.  Silly cars, you are not boats. Get out of that water.  Jesus.  I hope everyone is ok. My thoughts and prayers are with them. Chocolate?!  /r/pics Time to move countrs TIL sunroofs are really popular in China Whoa, flooding? Caused by a typhoon? That's *insane* I am a terrible person for wanting to jump from car to car like those childhood games I would play. The water is the lava in this case.  TIL there are only two models in cars in Shanghai. And a van. I love this game! This level seems hard though...I still can't figure out how to slide that red car out At least we'll see some new JDM parts on ebay. (Little to no rust) Dammit Bill!! You let the coffee pot overflow again for the third time this week! - Move black car forward 2 squares
- Move truck back 1 square  
- Move red car forward 1 square
- Move black car back 2 squares to original position
- Your car is now free to exit the parking lot
- Your solution: 4 Moves, Best Solution: 3 Moves Unblock car, Shanghai edition Even the cars in Shanghai look the same as each other SHIT BITCH The personal submarine market there is booming!  Sounds like a movie opportunity.  Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson in Shanghai 'Phoon. *Soggy car for sale* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't where I parked my car.  You all missed it.  The air is clean for once. It looks like an unblock me puzzle, with the one red car.  If the parking lot is like this what will the subways look like there?? &lt;insert&gt; joke of how Asians can't drive &lt;/insert&gt; Wait, isn't this shit exactly why they destroyed like 5 cities and flooded an entire valley while spending billions on the largest civil engineering project ever? What happened to that? Wasn't the Three Gorges Dam supposed to prevent all this? Hopefully everyone is alright! It's very rare to see a school of carfish this close to the surface. Why is there so little variety of cars?  I used to live in South Asia and this is what the streets looked like pretty much every monsoon season.  Yes, flooding happens and it can drown cars.  It's a regular occurrence.  This is not WtF. Tell the kids to hop from car to car and pretend the water is lava. Belong to r/pics GODDAMN MONGORIANS BREAKING MY CITY DAM! Wasn't there another storm recently? Must be getting the ones meant for the us. It's been Very quiet here in Florida. Weathermen are bored. Bet yer not bitchin' about haulin' your groceries up that flight of stairs now are ya? Your friend could make a fortune selling vehicle platforms. Sitting just 2-4 feet off the ground. Place the ramps down. Drive the vehicle up. Put the ramps up. Car safe from having the engine flooded and vehicle become waterlogged. Looking at the thumbnail, I thought they'd scored a shitload of phones/tablets. I think the point is that not only are the cars wet, but WTF is parking there like? Seriously horrible parkers.

(I realize the water did this and this is not really WTF). With all this water being put into places that it was never meant to be, I'll bet we're going to start seeing some amazing superbug bacteria growing and causing horrible infections.  

I just got out of a month long stay in the ICU with pneumonia, they cultured my blood and couldn't identify the bacteria that almost killed me.   Wow! They've replicated Venice and their boats look more like cars. All I can think of is how great of a game, "ground is Lava" Shock one would have.  Pretty difficult to hold their tennis open outside in that weather and a strange season to hold one.  Feel sorry for the folks who live there and hope things get better soon. This looks more like Shanglow Are car interiors sealed off well enough to prevent the inside cabins from being flooded or are all those cars basically fucked? Born in New Orleans, this is nothing to me. Typhoons cause excessive jpeg compression artifacts? How is this WTF? Typhoons are full of water.  Shitty. Is this out of the ordinary?  Silly cars, you aren't turtles. You don't even live as long.  Is a car usable after it is totally submerged?  Shanghai'd in Shanghai! TIL typhoons suck at vehicle tetris Seems like the typhoon requires some lessons in tetris tactis OH SHIT THE WORLD IS SINKING! They can't park very straight, that's for sure! Mmmm...car soup.

My favorite... Am I missing something here? Did all the cars turn black and silver? Your fat mate? Todd Carty is that you? I.e. Mario's daily commute. Just appreciate the photo you fawkers I feel like I'm missing something. why does this have so many upvotes? it's a flooded street.... That's some next level Frogger right there whenever i see footage of a typhoon hitting asia, it seems that no one evacuates.  carpool party? Probably a stupid question, but aside from all the electrical stuff, can cars come back from being submerged like this? Like after all water is drained, and dried back out? Waisthai  /r/pics is over there ---&gt; This would be one of those times I left my windows down with my luck. They need better drainage. It's a good thing my iPhone is waterproof. Heh Car pool anyone? They should have had the "Hover Van" ^TM So long Beach? 
 HOLY SHIT I HOPE THOSE CARS HAVE GEICO! ( insert ad here) Looks like cereal. "We're gonna have to leave now if we're gonna wade to work."

"It"s cool, I brought my kayak."

"Alright, we have a few more minutes of dry." Shang-hai water. 
 I bet that water is delicious. Horrible parking job. isn't that bad for cars? Guy in the top right is comfortable at least. I'm late for this, but,

It's a water level now? i really want to jump between the roof of the cars. must feel like froger. The sucks, how many kids do you two have? Oh man, when this hits fukushima, were fucked bet you wish you had a hover van now Looks like GTA2. On the bright side, water front views for everyone. My brother lives in Ningbo. They are a few hours from Shanghai. Here are the [results](http://imgur.com/fa9cGwC).

Actually, going through my brother's photos, I think he's the original photographer and OP's "Mate." They look like vehicular crocodiles. Carcodiles.  ~ mom "A little rain never hurt anyone."

~ Robin Williams "Yeah, but a lot can kill you."

-Jumanji Anyone for some car soup? *Asian drivers* Mmm... chocolate milk A little rain never hurt anybody. Let me dig up some real WTF from New Orleans... Somehow I figured Chinese cars would float a little better Looks like a typhoon lagoon... In Miami it smelled like shit when the streets flooded... But the water was clear. I can't even imagine how bad it smells there. Somewhere, a CarFax sales rep is excitedly rubbing his hands together... That one guy just had to park like a dick.. Obviously the typhoon is a little OCD. Those cars at right angles and all.  Typhoon Fitow - Affecting Huzhou, Ningbo, and Zhejiang on the Eastern coast of China.

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/hf4OI) of pictures from friends in China. Shit, does this mean hard drive prices are gonna go up again? It's iced coffee! reminds me of a bowl of cereal for some wierd reason  Press Right, R2, Circle, R1, L2, Square, R1, R2.   Omg the storm washed a bunch of vehicles and buildings into the river. Crazy It looks like a video game. Jump on the cars to get to the next location! If you fall in the water the invisible water demon will kill you! Reminds me of that game where you have to gove the other cars to get the red one out of the parking lot. So...many...sunroofs! serves those fuckin gooks right for Pearl Harbor. His camera is shitty. Did he take that with his Logitech webcam from 1998? Throw some potatoes and carrots in there and you got a stew goin' I take it black and white are the top 2 colors of cars sold there.  are they all floating or does everyone in Shanghai just park like assholes? better show me the car fax Water front property! Is it me or does that remind me of like a bar of chocolates with hazelnut in them...except its cars. Hell, I'm just sitting at home doing some computer shit and THIS is how I found out there was a typhoon in Shanghai! Well, I guess I should of looked out the window. or maybe your "mate" doesnt live in shanghai, and this is just a picture of cars after a typhoon Where is the collapsed skyscraper? TIL a typhoon hit China. Salvage cars, salvage cars everywhere  Man that typhoon pulled off a real Siege Of Shanghai If you think this is bad you should've seen Hurricane Andrew or Hurricane Katrina's damage. Frogged! THIS DOESNT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE SIEGE OF SHANGAI, LETS SUE DICE! all the colours washed of the cars? Show me the carfax. Not going to lie, my first reaction was to think this looked like car cereal in chocolate milk... I'm apparently a terrible human being. What is....bad parking? The objective is to move all the other cars in such a way so you can slide the red car out. It looks like one of those 'move the cars' [puzzles](http://cdn9.staztic.com/app/a/1221/1221424/move-the-car-free-puzzle-game-680515-2-s-156x156.jpg) it looks like cereals poured in milk, but for robots. Rush hour Better have vehicle histroy reports over there.... seriously hope everyone is okay. just the chinese way of washing a car If their was ever time for the ultimate game of hopscotch.... always wanted a house on the water He must wait for everything to Shangdry How's this even wtf..... "Wtf this doesn't look like the Battlefield map. Game is total BS." Awh that's cute they have their own pool ^_^  Only black and white cars. Weird.  looks like the busy harbor app. "my mate" must be Australian, love that word I just don't understand...why this is in WTF... Most people just say "Significant Other" or "Lover." Well there goes my plans of moving to Shanghai  Yep, these "typhoon" things tend to do these things called "floods". Is it weird that i'm imagining that as a river and a giant game of car-tetris?

marijuana. Is it wrong that I imagine they just get out of their cars and act as if it is a normal day?  Shanghai and dry! Looks like the typhoon laid down some fresh concrete. *Shhhh, they'll never find us!* OMG The typhoon hit the chocolate milk factory? And I bet our government will send money Hey Auto insurance FUCK YOU.   Looks like the picture was taken at Shanghai Noon. looks like a game of rush hour, but with more water
 6 years in China and I still can't decide whether the water moved the cars around or this just is regular Chinese parking. Unblock me. 

Difficulty: Master.  Awww, someone made Car Soup. Here in Taiwan, flooded automobiles are often resold and the buyer is not told. You do what you can to make sure you don't get a 'Typhoon 'Car'. You and about 3 other people have the same mate. Cars for sale. Real clean. Inside and out. Mmm.. Car Long Bao They park worse then my wife Damn, that's a lot of cars. Hope your buddy is O.K. though!
  All the cars have melted!  I can't believe that Asians suck that much playing Tetris. A lot of water, yes. WTF, I think not.  Shanghai, I spent a month there one night. This seems like a normal result of a typhoon, "wtf" doesn't exactly come to mind. If i wanted to see pictures of flooding, i'd go to /r/weather or /r/pics. a flood is the result of a typhoon? mind blown.  Should be in /r/pics not /r/wtf For some reason this is all i see 

http://goodeggfoodie.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_1440-lo-res.jpg?w=652 I live in Suzhou in Jiangsu but I'm currently on vacation in Boracay in the Philippines.

I wonder if Suzhou got it bad too. It's not far from Shanghai. Though, I think Suzhou handles rain better. Especially the SIP district where I live, which is very modern and was built by Singapore by what I understand.

I just wonder because my girlfriend lives in my place in Suzhou right now. But I think she's fine, she was talking to me just a few hours ago.

But yeah, looks like we left at a good time. We left just Sunday night. The typhoon was in transit from the Philippines to China at the time, so we must have flown right over it on our way here.

The Philippines has high water right now... but I think that's pretty normal for here. Still, I feel bad for people here. I feel like a rich asshole living on top of the poor when I look out of my comfy tour bus and see people trying to ride bikes through the water and the living conditions outside of the tourist areas here. Thanks Obama They don't have much of a variety if cars there, do they? and people in new england thought they had it bad,
lawl Holy shit thats a lot of nesquik.  Came here to read the Battlefield references. /r/justtyphoonthings u wot m8? Looks like the screen after I attempt to play Tetris on super hard mode. I thought this was a post about Battlefield 4. I need to get out more. Who ordered a bowl of car soup? There was a typhoon? Look at all the pretty fishy's...  Oh man I hated that damn puzzle game. They should call it a..... Thaiphoon  It rained cars? I love these unblock your car games. That is a lot of coffee! **Mate as in girl friend or something else?** I would normally call my mate my SO. Mostly because of all the mating. Terrible parking job, eh. My first thought when I saw this was "Miso soup!" (Yes I know it's not Japan. I just work for a Japanese company so I see a lot of miso...) It must be a pretty bad typhoon to make all those people park like assholes in the middle of the road. Looks like its.... "rush hour" Awww Yeah! Damn Asian drivers. I love me a bowl of Cocoa Cars in the morning!  I'M COOCOO FOR COCOA CARS! Mmmmm Car soup! Mmm, car soup Chinese car wash this looks like it'd be the best game of don't touch the lava ever..
 I want some car-shaped cereal in some chocolate milk. They see me floatin.... They hatin.... Patrolin they tryna catch me floatin dirty It's like car tetris. Worst park jobs ever I guess your friend is now in*puts on sunglasses*Xiahai DAE BF4? Car soup Free swimmingpool!! Is it wrong that all I can think of is playing real life Frogger across those cars? As an American teenager going to school in Shanghai, it's a totally different experience than living in my hometown of Detroit.  Time to go fishing LEVELUTION

/r/imgoingtohellforthis Do they only make 3 kinds of cars there?  Now in China, two colors of cars to choose from! ohh look koi, in my car Worst. Valet. Ever. TIL you can park wherever you want in shanghai
 More proof the Asian's Can't drive. When will they ever learn. Water way.. highway.. not the same.  Just level with us... Why did you leave a kid in a burning car? That's one hot tranny.
 If you look closely, you'll have looked closely.
 Car burned down?  Must be some kind of Aussie phenomenon. If you look closely, it looks like a fire ghost is appearing on the top of the vehicle. The smoke in the top left looks like the outline of a skull.  This is reddit. Don't tell the truth behind your post; say what will generate the most karma: "Flame-engulfed child tries to escape burning vehicle." I don't see a kid? Looks like Ariel the mermaid talking to Sabastion the crab. Yes it does. That's freaky. Your car is haunted..

edit: burn it again Wow wtf  That looks like a ford exploder? Same thing happened to my mom and sisters when my mom was about 8 months pregnant with me. This was back in the late 60s. My oldest sister noticed fire coming up through a hole in the floor, and they were able to pull over and get out before it really went up.  You should post this in /r/creepy too So thats where i put my son. Huh. don't tell my wife is that Jimmy Hoffa in there as well lol? WTF are u talking about. I think you've been watching to much of the Discovery Channel Don't listen to him  Kinda a more r/creepy post than a r/WTF, but this is pretty interesting. Poor kid. Wife of Abe Froman, Sausage King of Chicago Someone needs to weiner off of those things. http://i.imgur.com/QgJUL.gif [today's standards are slipping](http://i.imgur.com/dyGSvBa.jpg) I wonder if she would make me wear a condiment . Granny Gaga. [A commercial she did in later years.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTriy1729l0) I imagine this is what top posters in /r/gonewild feel like. The Jews rigged it. They're so crafty. come on you're making this to easy  She's quite the sausage fest...:P http://i149.photobucket.com/albums/s51/rcape/sixties-hari-kiri-magazine-cover-2.jpg "I wish I were an Oscar Mayer Weiner..." 

Edit: Spelling They should have outfitted her with a sausage scepter  Wheres the Now picture? I can't imagine the hot dogs aged very well.  And why Zion? Hmmm... Hot Dog Week? Sounds like a sausage-fest And people thought Lady Gaga was the first in a meat dress... Her face says "hurry up take the picture and get these damn things off me!" She's proud of her wieners... Got room for one more?
Also,  Sausage hat! Another Zionist conspiracy **WIENERS** zion? yep, that's a wtf alright... The Sausage King of Chicago approves. the original meat dress. I wonder if she knew the diaper queen?

http://www.retronaut.com/2013/02/miss-diaper-queen/
 Why does it say Zion on her sausage headdress? Am I the only one looking at this picture and saying "Damn, the quality of hot dogs sure has gone down the drain." Gaga is such a fucking poser. She kind of looks like Jenny Slate http://www.zap2it.com/media/photo/2012-01/333034320-01134829.jpg someone should probably start to weiner off of those things... She wore a meat dress before Lady Gaga! Lean, firm, and fully packed. So this is lady gaga's inspiration.. I'd stick my wiener in her buns. She looks sooo uncomfortable. She was hotter than I was expecting I just got the strangest boner... I know the weenie man, he owns a weenie stand,
He sells everything from hotdogs to buns, hey! 
One day I'll change his wife, I'll be his weenie wife, 
Oh, how I love the weenie ma-a-aaan! Hey!  Trick my trick!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcDodfL0Ce4 What do you do to get queen? Well since it is in the 40s it was probably a way for people to take their minds off of the war, or if its 1940 then the coming war in Europe and the pacific. Dat fake smile I read this title on mobile and thought "Please be in a hotdog dress."

Not disappointed. Well that's not what I expect when you say sausage party. anyone else get a sudden urge to watch interracial porn?  this picture is better if you imagine all the hotdogs are moving
 Ewww La La! Has anyone pointed out how that would smell? Mmm. Her face screams "Oh god what have I done with my life?" I knew lady Gaga was unoriginal!  Release the hounds! Iff you know what I mean... Hot Say, that's swell pic of that dame, but what's the big idea with them frankfurters, are you some kind of wise guy? The longer I look, the harder I laugh. This isn't really WTF. I mean, we *know* she's the Queen of National HotDog Week so we *know* why she's wearing hot dogs.  I have the weirdest boner. Huh.  So women have been doing that stupid arm thing since at least the 40's Nice sorsage on her wrist there. Queen, or hottest (only?) woman willing to drape herself in hot dogs? I'd eat all the sausage for her What a bunch of baloney! Ahmadinejad would be so pissed TL;DR Constant dissapointment to my father, whom I idiolize.

Edit: I suck at engliz I'm slowly starting to figure out that back in the day, men just created all these stupid "queen of whatever" to dress hot girls up in ridiculous outfits and laugh at them. why'd we stop doing that? she looks like someone is making her do this by gunpoint
 Because she likes wieners. The wiener queen! The water is lava. Go! I always wondered what Luane Platter would look like in real life.  Her name is [Geene Courtney](http://i.imgur.com/vagTCQ1.jpg) and she was the Sausage Queen for the Zion Meat Company in 1955.  She died in 2000.

Here is a [biggie sized version (2946x4087)](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7127/7613851530_08a20e60d3_o.jpg) of the image.

Edit: She was also in the Three Stooges film ["Booby Dupes"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnDVakzIyeo) I feel dirty thinking how fuckable she was and knowing she is either dead or in a rest home. (insert wiener Joke here)  i haven't been draped with that many weiners since...well you know where i'm going with this.  I'm sorry, but that's just too many weiners for one girl. Instant Ren and Stimpy imagery. Anyone else? And so begins the dark world of food fetishes Even his teacher calls him the hotdog queen "I just love my St. Paul pork products!" Looks like Karry from King of Queens She wants the(D)og She must get alot of wiener. What did the king look like?? i think the Zion hat makes the costume 1,000,000% better The look on her face says "Will someone take all this off now?" When I was Miss Baltimore Craaaaaaabs!  I haven't seen that many wieners on a woman since op's mom was at the homeless shelter. Pic doesn't show the 2 she's hiding. I'd like to give her my hot dog if you know what i mean... lady gaga looks less original.  I'd like to stick my weiner on her as well The smell......the *smell*........ Whats with the Zion hat?
 Looks kinda uncomfortable

"This is my life now, this is what I do" Meat dresses were cool before Lady Gaga I bet hot dogs weren't the only type of weiners she was good with. ;)
 There's a town near where I live that crowns a Watermelon Queen every year during their annual Watermelon Thump festival.  Wonder what the qualifications for winning that one are.   "I am going to kill my agent." Ok, since I may be the only one who noticed this but Zion in hebrew means wiener Who would have known that 73 years later, a woman covered in sausage would hold such a different meaning That's pretty risqué for back then. Looks like a wiener. Zionist pigs! Penis...joke...overload...can't...compute...argh! The original meat dress. Take that Lady GaGa  jews - I heard they put drugs in the hot dogs to dumb down Americans. Looks like Betty White I've got a hot dog for her. No really, its on the grill right now. Matrix? Wonder if she had to swallow a few "weiners" to become the queen. lol [**HERE'S THE RUNNER UP**](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdk4xmfAmJ1qgos7ro1_1280.gif) ZION ZIONIST SWINE! I''d hit it. Lady Ga Ga's grandmother?  Now that's a girl I'd let cook my kielbasa ;) What did he stab him with? Pork Sword? Man, pussy must be a real rarity for them to fight over it Quest for Fire style. "Shouldn't have" You know it started as something really small, like his buddy wouldn't pass the ketchup. It was incident after incident, until finally during the threesome he had had enough. Seems like as good a reason as any to stab someone.  We've all been there before. I always bring a knife to a threesome.  That's more respectable than hogging the NSFW tag. "It's my turn in the butt bro!!" Am I the only one wondering WTF was he doing with a knife while having a threesome??? "Shouldn't of"

*ears start bleeding* Hey this happened in my town! Really, it is the only thing to have happened in Fargo, other than the flooding that threatens to kill us all every Spring. shouldn't have, either It does say gay men, so more likely he was hogging all that booty hole. I'm old greg, I have a mangina! shodent off Black people problems Come on!  We've all been there and overcame our urge to stab the vagina hog. Source please! Pleaaase informative murder porn This reminds me of the belt from How I met your mother. You stop yourself from doing the 3-way because of the belt. Remember friends, sharing is caring. Sooo, not so happy Valentine's Day... Niggas be thirsty.
 Hell, I'd stab somebody for not passing a joint. [deleted] For anyone wondering, she's not really dead. This is performance art by Guatemalan artist  [Regina José Galindo](http://www.latinart.com/artdetail.cfm?img=gt_galin_08_md.jpg)

Those have all kinds of uses. "There's a special dumpster for those over there." Number one reason I love Mexico. I'm outraged they didn't recycle  Bring Out Your Dead...Bring Out Your Dead well will you look at that in both mexico and america you get one guy working while three are just watching. Doesn't mean there was a murder. Could have been a really complex accident.  He should get out of that plastic bag, he might suffocate. Oops one of Dexter's victims washed up on shore again. Is this another pic from that art thing against human trafficking?

I think it is...

that makes this like 50% repost

and since its fake is it even wtf?

no not really  performance art He dumped me. I dumped him at the dump Welcome to Mexico. This is how you take people home from the pet store Dexter got as lazy as his writers at the end there. Idk how one calls this art.... You people are fucking sick! Everyone has become de-sensitized, a life is worth nothing anymore but hey when does the new iPhone come out?  Standard operating procedure for the Mexican Government's Witness Relocation Program. The problem is people include humans in their festival budget. When the festival is over they leave the human behind with all the other unwanted rubbish. If the human is still in good condition they are taken to charities for resale. Hmm?... does Mexico have any recycling plans? fucking tragic. that should have went in the recycling bin Hey, Boss. Look at this! Someone didn't recycle! At least the embryotic fluid didn't spill.  I see they do not  sort there garbage tisk tisk Fuck you people with all your lame ass non-funny jokes. A person died, murdered in fact  Looks like a Caucasian female mid twenties, South California/Pheonix if I had to guess. Black trash What a wait there are kids in Ethiopia who would love that bag but no go wrap it around a dead chick Maybe no1 will notice, next time get a black bag u idiot  Tell your buddy to quit fucking the sheep in their ass and it won't prolapse The pic came with this text "One of my sheep shitting out his own rectum. We plugged it back in but Yea. Then he shat it out again. So we put that white pipe you see in to create him a new asshole. The spaghetti you see is rubber band that holds his new asshole together"
 Welsh ingenuity!  why is there cigarette butts stuck in it? This happens fairly often with sheep. When i was a kid we use to see this with our sheep, especially at the county and state fairs. Brace yourself for incoming Welsh jokes.. You could just fucking describe it in the title for fucks sake. You know, what titles are meant to do? Looks like my French bulldog after someone fed him a lamb shank at a super bowl party. What's the deal with sheep being consistently involved in anal destruction? Can someone from New Zealand weigh in on this topic, please? Look at all of you making sheep-fucking jokes, one after the other...just like a bunch of sh...shit [deleted] Please put that poor thing down.  Tell the farmer to leave this ewe alone for awhile!

 Uggggh....
I can only imagine the pain this sheep is in. Glad

Rx for all sheep except the one in the pic: Adequate water and additional dietary fiber.

Rx for sheep in the pic: Captive bolt stunner or a well placed .22LR. BANG.  Well, there goes my appetite forever Literally shitting its ass out lol please don't tell me he sodomized that sheep Most likely occurred during the sheep giving birth.

Stop posting pictures of [Ava Devine](http://www.xvideos.com/video507869/ava_devine_avy_lee_roth_ayla_mia_prolapse_3_scenes) Jeez. NSFW The best knot is a ratchet strap. Fifteen years ago I was working for a construction company near Raleigh. One of our employees was driving a flatbed pickup truck on the beltline, loaded with 50-pound bags of portland cement. If you've never handled the stuff, dry portland cement is about as fine as talcum powder.

A 2x4 fell off of a truck in front of our guy. Our guy ran over the 2x4 at 70+mph, causing the back end of the truck to jump. 8 bags of dry cement flew up in the air, the truck drove out from under them, they fell to the road surface and exploded.

Instant smokescreen. Total whiteout in heavy traffic.

If everyone had stopped, they probably would have been fine.  
If everyone had kept going at the same speed, they would have driven through it and been fine.  
Instead, people in the front slammed on the brakes. People in the back tried to keep going.

22-car pile-up because of a fucking 2x4. Quick turn the wipers on! 
*survives in one piece *
I can't believed that wiper thing worked!  Heading  South on I-5 a few years ago:
A guy driving a company van  on a stretch of 70mph highway didn't even stop after he saw that the giant piece of plexiglass flew off the top of his van, shattered on my windshield and then chunks went flying into other cars. I caught up with him a moment later and we locked eyes. You knew, bro. You knew, and you didn't care. It was so sad, it raised it's little wiper arms to protect its face as it fell! As a navy man my motto is, "If you can't tie knots, tie lots".  Granny knot after granny knot after granny knot...... http://www.animatedknots.com/ The California state transportation department reported that over a two-year period between 2005 and 2007, 155 people were killed as the result of debris from unsecured truck loads.

Washington state passed Maria's Law, named for Maria Federici, a young woman in her 20s who was blinded and disfigured when a piece of furniture flew off a trailer and smashed her windshield. why is it whenever a car rolls the wipers activate? comic relief? Years ago I was driving down the freeway behind a Crystal Water truck. The guy had failed to secure one of the plastic 10 gallon (I think they're 10 gallon, not sure) jugs that go on office water coolers. It popped out of its holder, hit the pavement directly in front of me, bounced completely over my car and landed on the hood of the guy behind me. It was amazing.  It was like the whole thing happened in slow motion.  It made an audible BLOOP when it hit the ground.  Luckily no one was injured. That's a very dangerous thing to happen on a 6-lane wide freeway where the average speed is 80Mph.  When you hit anything going that fast, it's dangerous.  Or just by some straps  You could also try not over correcting yourself into a ditch. I watched this for 5 minutes and still can't figure out how the guy with the dash cam reacted so badly.

Still the other guys fault, but wow. If you can't tie a knot, tie a lot. I think he over reacted a bit If the guy would have calmly pressed on the brakes, he wouldn't have hit the board, and would have saved his car.

"Hmm, obvious danger! Let's drive into it." http://reddit.com/r/dashcamgifs Was it really that serious for the driver to lose control like that?  I fucking love dashcams. That almost happened to my mum and me the other day. We were driving back from South Padre Island, I was driving my car while my stepdad was driving his car behind me. We both were doing like 70mph in the highway, when this sanababish pickup truck with a bunch of steel rods in the trunk started dropping them off like bananas in a Mario Kart game. Shit got crazy, they were skidding from side to side of the road, and one nearly stabbed the front of my wife's Civic. 

Luckily both me and my stepdad managed to evade them, but the mother fucker in the pickup truck saw it and was like "Meh.." I had almost the exact thing happen to me in Miami on I-395 going to the beach.  Overloaded "camper" truck in front of me, something told me to watch out, half second later a door goes flying off of the roof of the camper.  Bullet time... I swerved at the last second as the door flew by my driver's side mirror less than 6 inches away.  

Miami is notorious for road debris and stuff flying off of trucks.

 I don't know about anybody else, but as soon as I saw it come off the truck, my brakes would have been ON.  This person didn't even hit the brakes until the very last second.  Dumb. Driving to You See Davis several years ago on Eye-Eighty just east of the Nut Tree / 505 exit, and some clown driving a pickup loses his load: a full-size sofa (white) lifts up and flies out of the truck bed, tumbles in the air a few times and lands on the highway at 65 mph, smashing into one million pieces, plus or minus.
  
I was in the fast (#1) lane.  I think he was in the #3 or #4 lane about 1/4 mile ahead of me.   Fortunately I missed hitting any of the debris which covered 3 lanes as I looked out my rear mirror.  About a mile later, he finally pulled over to the side of the road, probably to change his underwear.

Tie down your load.  Use twice as many ropes as you think you'll need. And if you put a mattress or plywood on your roof, tie it down from front to back, attached to both bumpers, a tow hook or trailer hitch, too. I failed the knots tying test in Boy Scouts and couldn't pass it with future attempts.  Did not make it to Eagle Scout because of this.  *NOTE:*  I am *not* the truck driver in this video. My Grandpa was moving and bought a new mattress, which he insisted he tie down to his minivan himself... I was about 8, and we were following from behind when it lifted off like a sail and probably made it a good 80 feet up before landing on the shoulder. I couldn't stop laughing for the rest of the day, and I learned that my Grandpa was an angry drunk that day as well.
-edit- we were on the highway doing maybe 70 when it happened lololololol /r/nononono More than likely the twine broke.  Something similar happened to my dad about a year ago.  He was driving on a two-lane country road (55mph).  A truck carrying sheets of drywall was coming in the other lane and a line broke, causing a sheet to come off.  It clipped the side of the car (somehow it was completely vertical he said), took the side-view mirror clean off, and gouged a good portion of the car.  He attributes it to dumb luck that it wasn't horizontal and didn't hit the windshield (although I don't know the ballistics of drywall when striking a windshield).  You gotta loopty loop and pull. Or, the better pro tip, is to not use rope. It is extremely hard to get it tight, so it is better to not take the risk. Use ratchet straps instead. It is possible to work miracles with ratchet straps.  I was driving in a carpool to work one day and we got behind a truck with plywood on it. I-90 at 7 am, traffic everywhere. Suddenly, a piece of plywood flies off the back of the truck in front of us. It was all the driver could do to swerve towards the shoulder. the plywood hit the car, fortunately we hit it on the broad side of it rather than it hitting edge on. My life flashed before my eyes. It was some seriously scary, Final Destination-type shit. Exactly that happened to me one dark night on an unlit highway. I suddenly saw massive sparks from the car in front, about 100m ahead. The sparks stopped, then reappeared, then stopped, then the car's muffler thunked down on the road right in front of me... bang. "If you can't tie a knot, tie a lot!" Seriously. As a slacker, I know what it's like to try to get by with the bare minimum... "this is probably fine" is good enough in most cases.

But it's really important to keep in mind when you're doing something that has the potential to destroy someone's life. And driving around with stuff sticking out of your vehicle is one of those situations. I have a friend whose mom is paralyzed because someone was casual about tying down a dresser they were moving. She was just out for a run. Remember: if you can't tie a knot, tie a lot. Is anyone else as impressed as I am that the windshield is intact? Happened to me about 5 years ago.  A Cadillac with a single sheet of plywood and a rope were driving on the highway about 200 yards in front of me, in the right lane of a two lane stretch.  It was a really windy day too.  I see the plywood come off and it's flying right at my car.  I was able to stop safely a foot or so from the plywood.  It wouldn't happen around here, there's usually one conscientious passenger with a hand out the window holding the mattress down. I was driving home the other night and something the size of a softball blew my driver's side mirror assembly off. I have no idea what it was, the nearest car was several hundred feet behind me, and the next nearest was about a mile ahead.

It was absolutely bizarre and completely terrifying.    This driver was an idiot for not slowing down. and / or learn to drive im always pretty scared driving behind a car with anything on the back driver is an idiot. immediately slamming brakes was probably best bet.  Totally the drivers fault. He over corrected, clearly he or she is a terrible driver. I don't understand how that made the car go off the road it looked relativity flat To be fair it looks like the driver of the dashcam vehicle reacted very poorly.  I once had a shovel drop out from under a vehicle in front of me.  That wouldn't have been so bad, but it went under the wheels and was launched into the air at very high speed.  Did I brake, swerve, and roll?  No. I let off the gas, laid over to the side in case it came through the windshield, and drove straight.  Fortunately, it missed my truck by mere inches, but swerving and braking like this is usually the worst thing you could possible do.  If you do swerve, stay in the ditch until you stop. I learned that lesson this summer.  Some bolts on my jeep's hard top had slipped out and I lost the top at 65mph at 2 in the morning on a deserted highway in Colorado.  Had someone been behind me, it would have been criminal negligence, and definitely manslaughter if I had killed someone.  I was lucky.   On the road, whenever I encounter a pickup with anything in the back, or worse some assface with a gun safe strapped to the top of his ford fiesta with a single bungie cord, I get in front of them post haste.  Especially if I'm on my motorcycle.  Stupid people kill every day.   On I-70, I saw a horse trailer come unhitched in front of me.  One minute before, it was looking wonky so I backed off about 150 feet.  Thing came off and veered to the right side of the road.  I wasn't super close then. At that point, I was trying to decide whether to stop or power past it.  An entrance ramp was to my right so I pulled into the space between the highway and the ramp where there should have been no cars.  The trailer hit the guard rail on the right side of the road, then proceeded back to the left in front of me across the three lanes and went into the ditch in the middle.  Scary as fuck.  Paying attention to your surroundings while driving pays off.  You can sometimes predict the accident before it happens.  

Death toll: None.  Horse had a gash in the head and I felt terrible for it because it looked so scared.  The horse haulers were freaking out, couldn't figure out their cell phone.  I made a couple calls for them and headed out.   At least his windshield wipers still work.  That's a silver lining. The reason wipers turn on in most accidents is because a driver's natural instinct is to grip the steering wheel near the top with both hands for impact and to protect the face, and usually it hits the wiper handle on the way up. Should have pressed the X button faster, and this could have been avoided. Fuckin QTE's.  10/10 on the landing  This happened to one of my dads friends. But the load hit is windscreen, and it was a sofa. The driver who lost his license on the spot. how about learn to drive and brake when you see a fucking big ass object flying in your direction Why does the lower part flash red briefly, like when you get hit in a video game?  Actually, that kinda looked fun! Must have been the rain. It was a perfect ohshitshank. I thought of That's So Raven where the car would just pop up after the crash and say "IM OK!!!" Didn't even crack the windshield. At least it wasn't a brick. Was there a blood splatter during the roll...? Seems like something I would want to brake for rather than swerve around. those are some tough windshield wipers Thats knot going to buff out. At least it wasn't a brick... I didn't know Nokia made windshield wipers.  I knew business was slow, but damn. Dude...this is totally knots Good thing he turned on his windshield wipers. Absolutely vital to his survival. Type of car?  Need to know.  SUV? "WHY DID YOU TURN!!!??" Good thing he turned his wipers on Don't be a dick and overload your truck? Awesome evasion maneuver. Does anyone know what happened after this gif? I would really hope that the person who crashed sued the living fuck out of the guy in the truck. Reminds me of the guy that threw the tray at the other guys feet and took him down. At least the wipers survived Thank goodness for the windshield wipers, though. The worst part about this video is that the RV just drove off... guarantee it Its mario kart and dash cam guy was gaining on him during the final stretch  Brain: DEBRIS COMING TOWARDS US. WHAT TO DO.

Hands: TURN RIGHT + WIPER BLADES. "Hey that thing just flew off that truck! Better just stay the same speed and spend the next 5 seconds watching when I could be actively avoiding it!" Did anyone else see the girl lying in the background, before it flipped over? The driver wrecked because he/she went off the road and over compensated when trying to straighten back up. Not because he/she hit the door or whatever it was. had they just run that shit over like a baddass the car would have not crashed. well, at least the windscreen wipers work. At least the windows got wiped.  I have a cousin, who about 10-12 years ago was driving a truck, with about 10 [Tracker](http://www.trackerboats.com/) boats tied down. The load was worth about 200-250,000 dollars. On one large stretch of highway near florida, 5 of the boats flew off the truck, due to the ropes snapping and he didn't notice until his next stop for fuel.

No other truckers radioed him on the CB, no highway patrol contacted him. He called the shop, and they told him to leave the truck where it was, don't touch anything, and get a cab to a hotel for the night. They had an investigator check the ropes, who determined that the ropes were faulty (rather than being tampered with, and that whoever secured them, tied their knots correctly, but failed to inspect the integrity of the rope.

My cousin was not considered at fault, and got to keep his job. The rope tier guy, was not so lucky. knot what I expected......wow, this comment sucks. Am I the only person that does not drive with a dash cam? Bet money the truck just drove away without even bothering to check and see if they were ok. why the fuck didnt he slow down I'm not an astronaut, but I did stay at a holiday inn express last night.  Hey we now know his wipers work!  I'm actually quite surprised that wreck didn't turn out much, much worse. Is the driver ok? And was that person caught for not securing their shit? Thought this was going to be about something else.  Was disappointed. Well we know which person isn't going to earn their knot tying badge this year....
 anyone else notice a BF3 hit indicator as that thing slammed into his car? Look closely Only cool knot I know how to tie is a square knot.  Did the bunny go over the bush or around it? Oh well, this'll hold. Whoa, he almost paid the iron price. Strongest windshield ever.  I think the wipers gave him the little extra momentum to roll the car. Where can I get that windshield...?
I don't see a single crack after a roll over. Learn to drive, you had plenty of time to slow down and avoid it BRACE FOR IMPACT
TURN ON WIPERS USER USED WINDSHIELD WIPERS! Dude desreved it, swerving left, always swerve right Those windshield wipers saved the day. I'm assuming this happened in Russia. This occurred on my birthday... Best late gift ever! that's what happens when you stay in the passing lane only.  How about, when you see shit flying on the road, slow down until you're sure it's safe, instead of hoping for the best and taking your chances? It looks to me like the driver could have avoided this just by slowing down. That exact same thing happened to me only the flying piece hit my windshield frame.  I could have been killed if it hit 1/2" to the right. If I see something like that I hit my goddamn breaks, rather than merely try to casually drift out of the way, but that's just me. That's knot cool.  "Oh look, a giant piece of metal flying off the truck in front of me. I'd better keep going at the same speed and make no attempt to avoid it. Oh no, I'm spinning out of control! I'd better activate my wipers." Thatll teach ya to NOT be in the left lane if youre not looking to pass someone. Once happened to me in Canada, a big truck was coming in from the front and dropped a 20'' x  20'' ice cube in my windshield at 90 km/h or more (55MPH+)  when I was passing by. Exploded my windshield in my face running at 90 km/h on a icy road because a lazy trucker didn't wanted to clean is truck that morning...  If the driver didn't slam on and hold the brakes, he wouldn't have ended up in the ditch.  Even better. Learn proper defensive driving skills so you dont lose control of the vehicle when shit like this happens. Dont rely on others to keep you safe on the road. When you have to pull off the road for aby reason dont just yank the car back into the lane while slamming the brakes. Because this is what happens.  Why would going over debris in the road cause you to crash? Poor accident avoidance caused this guy to end up in the ditch. I have been completely perpendicular to the highway going 60 on black ice and recovered without leaving my lane.  Damn, I hate it when I roll out of bed unexpectedly.  Need robot cars that can take over and make the perfect controls to not result in an off road crash. Insurance for drivers without robot cars is going to be a lot in the future :( Should have breaked. Dumb fuck.  This happened on my birthday.  I bet the truck driver did KNOT expect that. Jesus.  Someone needs to change their pads more frequently.  I'd bet she smells of death. Am I the only one worried that "period pictures" seem to be slowly starting to become a trend, I'm mortified. She even took time to make a colage of it... Spoiler: She was. Removed from bucket list: earning red badge of courage. You shouldn't have done that, he's just a boy. Good lord, I can smell it.  As a woman I have no idea what the inspiration or motivation it is for someone to take a picture of their pads. I just...don't get it. Why the hell would you post a photo of your pad and your stained panties.  I'm glad you're not pregnant, but fucking come on. 

If you have to prove you're having your period to someone, keep it between them and you.

Yes, menstruation is a wonderful, cool thing that women's  bodies do and there's no shame in it but I don't have to SEE it.   Did somebody ask "pics, or it didn't happen"? Thats it im going to throw up Someone posted this to twitter, and eating lettuce made me fat. My eyes. Dear god. My eyessssssssssssssss. I think I have that pair of panties... What is going on? Why are girls taking pictures of this? I remember when I was younger being mortified when I would buy Kotex or tampons. 

Plus this girl is nasty. Look at that pink fingernail touching that blood. She is going to get chaffed if she doesn't keep herself clean.  no they didn't. Miley? WTF. Either she had a miscarriage into that pad, or she hasn't changed it in days. Jesus fucking christ. /r/ttotm  It's green? How...?  Probably was pregnant. The body will "auto-abort" if it senses something is seriously wrong with the embryo. This explains why she thought she was pregnant (well past her usual time) and the rather large discharge. It's a good thing she wasn't pregnant; I don't think her child would have much of a chance. I see so many pictures on my Facebook newsfeed, Twitter feed, etc. that make me say to myself, "Really?" But this? This is just a whole new level of "Are you fucking kidding me?" http://i.imgur.com/o0rC54L.gif what exactly happens when women get their period? Bloody Mary team tampons. It looks like a chicken egg. Why is there greens in there?!?!?
 Sure, sometimes after worrying about being pregnant, starting your period can be one of the most amazing things EVER. And well, perhaps you'll have the urge to share the great news with someone... like your boyfriend or your best friend...


This? This is just wrong. woah, that's a lot of blood. Sure she didn't get stabbed? Well, I guess I'm done with dinner now.  I'm an EMT and see far worse on a daily basis and this made me nauseous... I really need to start finishing the title before I click. OMGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!! This almost makes me want to be gay How nasty it's fucking green on the sides. Why???? NOOOO no no I am traumatized!!!
I expected this to be a pix-promo for that new vagina t-shirt. (Ugh)
I'd say as a people... We are about done~ Let us all thank God, or whatever we put our belief in, for one more month that this person was unsuccessful at reproduction Oh god I can smell it through my screen http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/3121944/burning-eyes-o.gif I just threw up in my mouth. that is probably the grossest thing I have ever seen. I cringed, hard. Why the fuck do I always pick these links while i'm eating something?  Meh, who needs to eat like ever after seeing this. That is excessive....miscarriage? I'd say she was right the first time; she was pregnant.  Just not now. Never trust anything that bleeds for five days and doesn't die.  come on guys, you don't have to be mean. It's not her fault she has a heavy flow and a wide set vagina. Miley is really going downhill fast. I've lived in an all girls dorm, and it was Always more disgusting than the co-Ed ones Dear lord, why is it green?!? I've seen that many times cause I'm a girl and that still made me gag!  This is why I'm gay.... **DIRECT LINK**

*shudders* i completely understand why some men are gay. is this a thing now?
 It appears, from the pictures, that a black woman is melting from the crotch outwards. Now there's someone who bakes bread all the time, but hasn't had to buy yeast in years.  Pics like these are why I keep a bucket next to my desk while skimming Reddit. ... Ew... 

And:		

Why the gloves? And why does the toilet water look like that? Yellow and red? When I had heavy periods, there was no yellow like that! Or is it just a bad photo? That is just...ugh. That's why I use the softcup instead of those nasty things. Some women seem to be getting a little wrapped up in themselves, without thing about how disgusting they really are.  What does she post when she thinks she is constipated? who in the HELL uses pads?! [deleted] Bullshit.  That delightful green smear on the pad is what really sealed the repugnance deal on this. God that girl is nasty. Jesus Christ that is disgusting as fuck.  I think you were pregnant. Just not anymore. Dude... No.  Well, it may have *turned into* a period. Definitely not pregnant anymore.  I can almost smell it ._. Pretty sure that's a miscarriage.  That looks like one FUCK of a period This reminded me why I chose the birth control I have. I don't have to deal with that nasty-ness. Yes, ladies, I understand it's completely natural, but just because it's natural doesn't mean in ain't nasty The only way that...thing could get pregnant was if a drunk dog on a treadmill accidentally stuck its dick inside of her and didn't pull out.  The words alone would've been more than enough but pics?? Nasty bitch! WHO ARE THESE NASTY WOMEN?! Second post like this in 2 days...keep your bloody vaginas to yourself ladies! Well no...she isn't pregnant anymore...looks like a fucking miscarriage! No one bleeds that much during a period normally. Blaack people, blaaack people, haaalf black, haalff people God had nothing to do with this...that looks like Satans work

Hail Satan!  WTF is wrong with his junk? This is at the Anarchist Book Fair at the Hall of Flowers in San Francisco. The guy with the giant junk would show up every year and he would even be at some protests, just hanging out naked. I'm curious as to why guy with the apron and sweatshirt can't fully commit. &gt;Bay Area Anarchist Council

Clearly they are there to fuck shit up.  well, he seems to be painting peace signs on the hunchback with the crazyballs. All in a days work. Lemon Party 2.0 I want a peace of that. Is he wearing a flesh tone fanny pack? I have no clue what else it could be.  San Francisco in a nutshell. Not sure if hernia or saline... reminds me of that weird ass cult in GTA V Looks like they're just participating in some anarchy. WTF is Larry King doing there?  Conceal and carry can be a challenge when naked. Why did he draw a peace sign on his hernia? Low res pic, so I cant tell if thats a fanny pac or enlarged upper prostate on the man being painted. This is the one time in life I would prefer a fanny pac. are they out to support the Lemon Party in an election?  Larry King has a boob covering his package We need a guy with balls like that running this country. We may be dealing with a hippie jam fest the likes of which we've never seen. Noahs bagels! Love the shape of his body, I would like 3d printed version of him.  Uhh. Look at his penis Vacuumed his balls...all in the name of peace...peace and big balls man. disgusting. I think I recognize some of those people from Topanga Canyon, 1969. OLD Hippies. Don't knock it till you've tried it. I recognize the guy kneeling down. He lives in my hood. I bet that keeps his penis warm all winter Only Bay area.. His dick looks like a botfly.  Benoit Balls Home... Sweet... Home... Makes me wonder if my parents knew anything about the Bay Area before moving here.  why does he have a breast instead of a penis? Is that James Quall on the right? Those are some gorgeous oranges! Of course it's the Bay Area. Is that one of the guys who likes to do the massive penis pump things?  The ones with the glass jars full of water etc... AH, the Bay I'm just wondering why no one has noticed red sweatshirt guy with a thumb in his ass the old naked guy doing the painting is giving such a judging stare for painting an old naked dude. That guy might want to get his balls checked out. I can't stop thinking about Nuts Magillicudy over there. Dad? Dude's got basketballs Is that the old dude's saggy belly or bloated balls?  I worked at Noah's once.   Bad Grandpa?! Hey, it's the lemon party guys! That guy on the left is ShirtCocking  I think this photo was on littlegreenfootballs.com some years ago.   That's a gay parade for ya. They just have to show off. This is how I envisioned peace. Oh man, that look paintbrush guy is giving the camera..  I literally heard myself muttering, "what the fuck?!?"

 dont fuckin lie. This is your attempt at 'source please'. I do. Someone enlighten me. Its just guys love, between 3 guys damnit im from the bay area.  Its a lemon party. These guys didn't give up the dream. Gramps! So that's where he's been all these years Dammit, thanks to this sub, I instantly recognize an untreated ingual hernia when I see it...:/ dudes got some fat ass balls
 Then why did you link this? And the message of peace is still ignored. What's going on with his... you know what? I think I'd rather have a drink than know the answer.  http://i.imgur.com/cDubDxx.jpg And you assume we do? I assume that Picasso there is saying, "Next?" Picture source:

Very, very NSFW Wtf are these the Vietnamn vets who were arrested earlier? The sign in the background "bay area anarchists" WHY THE HELL DOES EVERY OLD MAN ON REDDIT HAVE MASSIVE OR DISEASED JUNK?! Looks like they're having a good old fashioned Lemon Party. The fuck is wrong with these people? Is that fred armisen on the right? So that's what larry king has been up to I'm guessing [Folsom Street Fair](http://www.folsomstreetevents.org/) Bay area anarchists?  Yay Areaaaaaaaaa Bay area... what a shocker. He's sporting the new natural fanny pack Larry King has finally found peace in his retirement Lemon Party 2: Sac Man Catches Geezer Fever. Thats not a fanny pack Seems like an average weekend to me. They're from the bay area, what do you expect? This dude looks just like Frohike from the Lone Gunmen


http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5d/Lonegun.jpg Peace, love, and penis. 
 It's a lemon party for peace, obviously. That's one huge nut sack Is this what goes on at Tomorrowland?  Is that Larry King?! No shoes, no shirt, no service! exactly how I picture the anarchists Good thing he's wearing shoes. Don't want to be stepping on any broken glass.  Why does every fucking naked old guy have an inguinal hernia? 

I'm 26, when should I expect mine? Every single time there's a picture of old nudist people, there's ALWAYS a goddamn guy with massive untreated hearnia... why??? To be fair, I think adults should be able to do as they please in the PRIVACY of their own homes.   How public is this?  Could my kids see this? Not ok.  http://i.imgur.com/Jbbne.gif Bay area = san Francisco


San Francisco = liberal


Liberal = mental disorder You'd think he'd get that fat depository seen to before he displayed his junk.. Or is it his junk?? Just tryin' to pick up on young hippie chicks.

Why you hatin', homie? This is anarchism? Sheeit. I better get started on filling out my product warranty cards and do my taxes. What degenerates...  We're like a political party. For *lemons*! Good to know that the Anarchist Club hasn't lost site of its Hippy roots! I guess you could call that a body bag

 Bay Area Anarchist Book Fair or something like that. They even have a facebook page Fuckin' Bay Area. Note to self, do not click on links posted in WTF comments.. They are almost always worse and more gross than the WTF posted.  i wish i could show this to all the "punk rockers" in my area rocking the Anarchy symbol. Of course I would probably go to jail for showing this to high school kids.. The guy in the middle looks like hes a fag bag, like lookin at a car wreck. Welcome to the Bay Area, CA. These guys are in GTAV They're Anarchists...So they're doing whatever the fuck they want!  "Bay Area" tells you all you need to know. Fucking freaks and losers. San Fransicko. It's weird that I've now said this twice today. Geocashing fetus! I have an idea. Hike somewhere, then write in blood, "THEY TOOK MY BABY" then have their vision turn red and make them hear crying baby noises. After that spawn some zsecs to come after you, which you quickly dispatch with a clever toss of a grenade. After that its on to that annoying moving bridge. (Wow I replayed doom 3 about 4 times) Babby is now Mountain Babby. There was a HOLE here.
It's gone now. You need to add "A Baby was conceived here." Just be sure to wipe your feet as you leave. Jesus? Who is Ababy?  What kind of name is that? My GF is now in the hospital awaiting twins, she hasnt been able to walk more than a few hundred feet at a time for the last 2 months, without getting tired or sore.  The only way she would give birth there is with a helicopter. Ababy? What's that some kind of Arab name? i wonder what ababy is doing now. This was probably written with the afterbirth.  thats kind of awesome
 Did. Did your girlfriend write it? That's so fucking ugly.  The peace of moss on the left kinda looks like a women giving birth. Here I was thinking it would simply say "first!" I bet is more babies were conceived there than born there. Who's Ababy? Graffiti!? WTF! I wonder if it was Kim Jong Il. Believe everything you read? Ababy is a strange name for a child. What was it written with... That's actually kind of awesome. As a colorblind person, this was way too hard to read. This isn't WTF material.  The ultimate Dutch oven! something about those ultraviolet lights screams shit yourself  They spelled 'cancer causing session' wrong. Dear Gawd this happened once when I went tanning, but I didn't do it. I was tanning and suddenly there was a disgusting smell coming from the hallway. I finished and a girl came out of a room and very quickly walked past me. The assistant walked in the room to clean it and immediately covered her mouth/nose and said, "Oh my f*cking God!" The girl had not only sh*t on the bed, she smeared it on the walls, floor and chair. There was a bathroom less than six feet away from her. I've heard that playing with fire makes you piss the bed, so maybe it's the same concept? Except helluva lot messier, and costlier.  And people wonder why I think tanning beds are unsanitary.  I wonder how many times pooping in a tanning booth needed to occur in order for them to put up a sign about it.  lots of people masturbate in them. So... like a Foreman Grill.  But for shit. Wow Racoon.

Completely wrong tail for a possum and nothing else in the region has that body structure Raccoon with a serious disease most likely Dummies.  It's obviously a Kardashian Chupacabra Its a skeever!!  Jersey Devil It's obviously one of the ROUS's badly burned raccoon seconded. [Here it is](http://remotecontrol.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/snooki-cartoon.jpg) Hope this helps!! Lupus Mangey raccooon Raccoon with mange?   Raccoon. With some hair issues. It's a skeever.  Raccoon with mange. Man bear pig. Since you're in New Jersey, it's probably Snookie's baby.

EDIT: typo. Sick raccoon :( feet and curvature of the spine give it away. Sarcoptic mange is an ugly, uncomfortable disease. Ugh. It makes me bummed. It's a fucked up raccoon- probably has mange and DEFINITELY had its tail cut off by something Its not even hard to tell that its a raccoon.. Mangy 'coon. It looks like it has been set on fire at some point. A diseased raccoon.  ***HOLY SHIT JERSEY DEVIL***  ^nvm ^thats ^just ^a ^hairless ^raccoon  Poor thing.  Call animal control and see if they can come and put it out of its misery. Prom night dumpster baby Skeever from Skyrim, tail has obviously been harvested by an alchemist. The 13th Leed's child.  Rodent of unusual size. Looks like a raccoon with mange to me. Burned Raccoon. Fucking piece of shit whoever did that.  looks like an extremely ill raccoon
 Raccoon w/ fire damage Used to be a raccoon.  Yeah, I'm gonna say someone tried to kill a raccoon with fire.
 Im 99.99% It's a raccoon with mange  It's a raccoon with mange Isn't that Snookie? How sad =( Definitely a Raccoon with a horrible case of mange Looks like he was burned at some point. Infection continues to harm him :( Poor thing needs to be helped or put down. Sadly coon with mange A very mange raccoon For what its worth as a "Collector of Tree Cats" we tend to see coons like this quite a bit, they love going into wall spaces, attics and other crap sometimes getting their fat little asses squished into areas they cannot get out of quickly.  The rest is we find a fair amount of them crispy up in attics after fires.   Then again I also see a lot of animals burned from kids starting fires or starting fires and throwing animals in it. A very sick raccoon. My first guess would be Raccoon, but maybe only because that pose is very similar to the one from The Brain Scoop. A diseased something. CHUPACABRA! snooki It's a raccoon with mange It's a fucking coon Fuckin' rakins. That is a very sick raccoon. You better call animal control if you haven't already It's a hodag! New Jersey state bird. Pretty sure that's some mange with a little raccoon. A badly burned raccoon.  It looks like someone poured hot oil on it.   Idk but kill it and put it out of its misery.  Snooki. Tail is too long to be Jwow. Looks like a cat who's down on its luck...whatever it is regardless. Feel sorry for the poor thing.  Coon. And they carry rabies. Kill it. Even if it's not showing signs of being rabid, it's got a host of other diseases. Kill it. It's just a prom night dumpster baby. [Probably this?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0pjh3zggxs) Definitely your mom.  I live in east orange what the hell is it. That's one fucked up coon right there, he has seen some shit recently. DEFORMED RACOON not real not real not real not real (puts hands over eyes) After seeing the post of a furless racoon a while ago, this is definitely another one in a very bad shape. Maybe it's a bear with some really bad hair loss, by the look of the paws and body, like a baby bear. A raccoon, probably has mange. El chupicrabra  http://i.imgur.com/tFyTMTI.jpg Obviously Yao Guai. Hungry. It's a Jersey devil.  Nasty diseased ass raccoon. LA CHUPACABRA DIABLO! It definitely has mange. As for what species... I thought it might be a cat and then I started to cry a little. Perhaps it's a little deformed from swelling and stuff. I'd study it more intensely but.. nope, I'm never opening that link ever again. Raccoon  I am 98% sure that it is a racoon which is losing its' hair. a poor sick maimed animal, and a strong will to live. Its a sick bear cub  That is a raccoon with a life threatening case of mange. Put it out of it's misery. I am North NJ..tell me where that dumpster is and where that thing lives so i can avoid it.. Oh poor thing :( Its a hairless cat covered in mud. Definitely a Racoon with a serious case of mange. Stay away from it! as a fellow north jerseyian, i need to know where this was. Looks like a raccoon that got torched Racoon that lost its fur Its a Racoon with Mange. Chupacabraj Danny Devito? raccoon with mange that would be in nj hahah (im from nj) CHUPACABRA! CHUPACABRA!!! *gasp* my pet dog has been found  It's combo "b". Obviously this is a Chupacabra. Poor thing was likely relocated from the southwest to NJ, I'd guess as a baby (the correct term is "chupababrito") when some kid picked it up, put it in their backpack on a family trip. It most likely slept all the way home and then, after not being fed by its mother or having been taught to hunt by its mother, simply started eating whatever it could find. Trash, leftovers, eventually trying to suck the innards out of the stupid child who picked it up and finding that because of its own natural instincts it was rejected and left out in the cold to have to look for food in the dumpsters of New Jersey. It's a sad story and one that will likely end in it being put down after eating several junkies and homeless out by a burger shack in the city.  So that's where my mom went this is so sad! it looks like a ratcoon that has been burnt, pure torture 
 It might be a skeever.  That makes me really sad :( poor thing. I know they're dangerous but I still think they're cute and I feel bad for it. So that's what a dumpster baby looks like... chupa cabre Ugly the cat Where in North Jersey?! ever heard of the mauntaug monster? you got yourself a ginny-ine cryptid bud. chupacabra el chuppacabra  Whatever it is that poor thing omgg I want to save it =(  IT'S A SNOOOKII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Sad [It's the montauk monster! It's alive! IT'S ALIVE!](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/RhodeislandMonster.jpg) I would say kill it with fire but it doesn't look like that worked the last time. did you see this anywhere near Englewood per chance?? Some kind of burnt cat *El Chupacabra!* That's a young bear who was probably climbing in there to die I'd hit it. With a shovel.  Snookie!!! snookies child I looked it up, it says here you should stick your dick in it... its a cat you idiots. with no leg hair It's a snooki! Diseased Opossum. I think its called a Snookie.  Its very famous  *LA CHUPACABRA* Please call your local animal shelter to have him picked up. He is suffering and in horrible condition. He should really be put down. Kill it with fire. No, really, that needs to be incinerated It's the Chalupacabra, the legend is true.  no clue what it is but you should have killed it and put it out of its misery Opossum. Ku Clucks Klan? Let me guess...made in China...$35.

Know how I found it? I googled "dumpster babies" and found it amongst the 100s of pics of similar messages on dumpsters. How long have you lived in the west?
